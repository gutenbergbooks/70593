<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> my early youth I heartily desired to know more
of the life of my great-great-aunt, Mrs. Elizabeth
Montagu. Every scrap of information I could pick
up respecting her I accumulated; therefore when my
cousins, Mrs. Wellesley and her sister, Miss Montagu,
in October, 1899, gave me the whole of her manuscripts
contained in 68 cases, holding from 100 to 150 letters
in each, my joy was unbounded!</p>

<p>In 1810 my grandfather, the 4th Baron Rokeby (her
nephew and adopted son), published two volumes
of her letters; these were followed by two more
volumes in 1813. To enable him to perform this
pleasing task he asked all her principal friends to return
her letters to him, beginning with the Dowager
Marchioness of Bath,<a id="1_FNanchor_1" href="#1_Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 1">[1]</a> daughter of the Duchess of
Portland, who gave him back the earliest letters to her
mother, many carefully inserted in a curious grey paper
book by the duchess, who placed the date of reception
on each, and evidently valued them exceedingly. The
Rev. Montagu Pennington returned her letters to his
aunt, Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, the learned translator of
Epictetus; Mrs. Freind those to her husband; and
many other people did the same. From General
Pulteney, at Lord Bath’s death, she had asked for and<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_viii">[viii]</span>
received her correspondence with Lord Bath, which
she carefully preserved. At the death of Lord Lyttelton,
the executors, at her request, returned her her letters;
those to Gilbert West and other correspondents were
returned in the same manner. Meanwhile she kept all
letters of her special friends, as well as notabilities, so
that one may deem the collection quite unique, though
doubtless many letters have disappeared, notably those
of Sir Joshua Reynolds, many of whose letters were
destroyed by an ignorant caretaker of Mrs. Montagu’s
house, Denton Hall, near Newcastle-on-Tyne. There
are none of Horace Walpole’s, from whom she must have
received some; and those from several other celebrities
she knew well are missing.</p>

<p>Owing to the enormous quantity of letters undated,
the sorting has been terribly difficult, and I spent one
entire winter in making up bundles and labelling each
year. My grandfather made a variety of mistakes as to
the dates of the letters. I hope I have atoned for some
of his deficiencies, though a few mistakes are probably
inevitable. He nearly blinded himself by working at
night, and my grandmother<a id="1_FNanchor_2" href="#1_Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 2">[2]</a> had constantly to copy the
letters in a large round hand to enable him to make them
out. After my grandmother’s death he discontinued
arranging them, though they might have been continued
till 1800, the year of Mrs. Montagu’s death.</p>

<p><a id="1_Footnote_2" href="#1_FNanchor_2" title="Return to text.">[2]</a> <i>Née</i> Elizabeth Charlton.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the present volumes only her early life is
presented, interwoven with portions of her most intimate
friends’ letters to herself. Were the whole of
this vast correspondence printed, a large bookcase
could be filled with the volumes. In order to consult
the varied tastes of the general reader, I have endeavoured
to pick out the most interesting portions of
her letters, such as relate to customs, fashions in<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_ix">[ix]</span>
dress, price of food, habits, but I have often groaned in
spirit at having to leave out much that was noble in
sentiment, or long comments upon contemporary books
and events. If life should be spared me, I hope to
be able to continue my narrative, for, like the ring
produced by a stone thrown on the water, her circle of
friends and acquaintances increased yearly, and not
only comprised her English friends and every person
of distinction in Great Britain, but also the most distinguished
foreigners of all nations, notably the French.
It has been asserted that Gilbert West was the first
person to influence Mrs. Montagu on religious points.
That his amiable Christianity may have strengthened
her religious opinions I do not deny, but I hope it will
be seen from this book that from her earliest days,
when at the height of her <i>joie de vivre</i>, the religious
sentiment was existent—a religion that prompted her
ever to the kindest actions to all classes, that had nothing
bitter or narrow in it, no dogmatism. Adored by men
of all opinions, and liking their society, she was the
purest of the pure, as is amply proved by the letters
of Lord Lyttelton, Dr. Monsey, and others, but she was
no prude with all this. Her worthy husband adored
her, and no wife could have been more devoted and
obedient than she was. His was a noble character, and
doubtless influenced her much for good. As a wife, a
friend, a <i>camarade</i> in all things, grave or gay, she was
unequalled; as a housewife she was notable, beloved
by her servants, by the poor of her parish, and by her
miners and their wives and children. She planned
feasts and dances and instituted schools for them, and
fed and clothed the destitute.</p>

<p>With Mr. Raikes<a id="1_FNanchor_3" href="#1_Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 3">[3]</a> she was one of the first people<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_x">[x]</span>
to institute Sunday-schools. She was as interested
in Betty’s rheumatism as she was in the conversation
of a duke or a duchess; a discussion with bishops and
Gilbert West on religion, or with Emerson on mathematics,
or Elizabeth Carter on Epictetus, all came alike
to her gifted nature. She danced with the gay, she
wept with the mourner; her sympathies never lay idle,
even to the very end of life; and in a century which
has been deemed by many to be coarse, uneducated,
and irreligious, her sweet wholesome nature shone like
a star, and attracted all minor lights. Where in the
twentieth century should we find a coterie of men and
women of the highest rank and influence in the world,
either from intellect or position, so content and devoted
to each other, so free from the petty jealousies and
sarcasms of the present fashionable society, so anxious
for each other’s welfare, socially and morally; so free
from cant or prudery, so devoted to each other’s
interest?</p>

<p>A great and terrible break in this book was caused
by the death of my beloved husband in May, 1904,
after a long, lingering illness. I doubt if I should
have taken courage to resume my pen if it had not
been for my friend Mr. A. M. Broadley, whose interest
in my literary work and affectionate solicitude for
myself has been a kindly spur to goad me on to action,
so as to complete the present volumes. To him I
tender my thanks for past and present encouragement,
as well as many other kindnesses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROBINSON FAMILY</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> entering on the life of Elizabeth Robinson,
afterwards Mrs. Edward Montagu, the famous <i lang="fr">bas bleu</i>,
the focus, as she may be called, of all the cleverest and
most intellectual society of the last half of the eighteenth
century, a few words must be said of the family she
sprang from. The Robinsons are said to have been
originally Robertsons, the name being corrupted into
Robinson. They are in many Peerages<a id="1_FNanchor_4" href="#1_Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 4">[4]</a> said to descend
from the Robertsons of Struan, or Strowan, in Perthshire,
who descended from Duncan de Atholia, Earl of
Athole, hence descendants of Duncan, King of Scotland.
My grandfather, the 4th Baron Rokeby, in an unfinished
pedigree, believed this, but there have been Robinsons
bearing the same<a id="1_FNanchor_5" href="#1_Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 5">[5]</a> coat-of-arms in Yorkshire as early
as the time of copyhold record in Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>’s reign.<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_2">[2]</span>
However, they may have been related. Our narrative
starts from William, said to be younger son of
the 7th Baron Robertson of Strowan, who, being
deprived of his portion of inheritance as younger son
by the Earl of Athole, fled into England, and settled
at Kendal in Westmorland, in the time of Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>
He had three children, Ralph, Henry, and Ursula.
Ralph married Agnes Philip, by whom he had William,
who succeeded to his father’s estates at Kendal and
Brignal, and who on June 7, 1610, bought the estate
of Rokeby in Yorkshire from Sir Thomas Rokeby,
whose family had been possessed of it before the Conquest.
Rokeby continued to belong to the Robinson
family for 160 years, when “Long Sir Thomas Robinson”
sold it in 1769 to John B. Saurey Morritt, the
friend of Sir Walter Scott. The Robinsons finally
assumed two lines (<a href="#ROBINSON_PEDIGREE"><i>vide</i> Pedigree</a>), William, the eldest,
remaining master of Rokeby, and his posthumous
brother, Leonard, becoming the direct ancestor of our
heroine. Leonard Robinson was a merchant in London;
he became Chamberlain of the City of London, and was
knighted on October 26, 1692. He married, first, Lucy
Layton, of West Layton, etc., by whom he had no issue.
For his second wife he married Deborah, daughter of
Sir James Collet, Knight and Sheriff of London, by
whom he had six daughters, all of whom married and
had issue, and one son, Thomas, who married a widow,
Elizabeth Light. She was daughter of William
Clarke, Esq., of Merivale Abbey, Warwickshire, and
heiress of her brother, William Clarke. By her first
husband, Anthony Light, she had one daughter, Lydia.
By her second marriage with Thomas Robinson she
had three sons. Matthew, the eldest, alone concerns us
as father of Mrs. Montagu. The following table will
show the connection between the Robinson and Sterne<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_3">[3]</span>

<div class="sidenote">THE MORRIS FAMILY</div>

<p>We now enter on the history of Matthew Robinson,
the eldest surviving son of Thomas, and his wife
Elizabeth. He was born in 1694, therefore was only
six years old when his father died. At an early age he
was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, and became
a fellow-commoner. He was a person of great intellectual
parts, a conversationalist and wit, the life of
the coffee-houses, which then served, as clubs do nowadays,
as a rendezvous for men of fashion. His talent
for painting was remarkable. His great nephew states,
“He acquired so great a proficiency as to excel most
of the professional artists of his day in landscape.”
At the early age of eighteen, in 1712, he married
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_4">[4]</span>Elizabeth Drake, daughter of Councillor Robert Drake,
of Cambridge, descended from the Drakes of Ashe in
Devonshire. Elizabeth’s mother’s name was Sarah
Morris. The Morris family had been seated in Kent
at East Horton since the reign of Elizabeth. Thomas
Morris, father of Sarah, built the mansion of Mount
Morris, sometimes called Monk’s Horton, near Hythe.
He had one son, Thomas, who was drowned under
London Bridge on his return from Holland in 1697,
ætat 23. His sister Sarah had two children by Councillor
Drake, Morris and Elizabeth. Their maternal grandfather
lived to 1717, when he devised his estates to his
grandson, Morris Drake, with the proviso of his assuming
the extra name of Morris, and failing of his issue
with remainder to Elizabeth, his sister, then Mrs.
Matthew Robinson. Her mother, Mrs. Drake, having
become a widow, had remarried the celebrated Dr.
Conyers Middleton, but had no children by him. The
following table will elucidate this:—</p>

<p>Elizabeth, the subject of this book, was about seven
years old when, by the death of her uncle, Morris
Drake Morris, her mother inherited, as his heir, the
important property of East Horton, and Mount Morris
in Kent. The family then left Yorkshire for residence
at Mount Morris. But before and after their inheritance
of the Kentish property much time was spent with the
Conyers Middletons both at Coveney, Cambridgeshire, a
property Mrs. Conyers Middleton had inherited from
her first husband, Councillor Drake; the advowson of
the living being hers, she bestowed it on her second<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_6">[6]</span>
husband, Dr. Conyers Middleton,<a id="1_FNanchor_7" href="#1_Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 7">[7]</a> whom she had
married in 1710; also at Cambridge, where was their
usual residence, and where several of the little Robinsons
were born in their grandmother’s house, as we
learn from a letter of Dr. Middleton’s. Elizabeth
Robinson was naturally much with her grandmother,
with whom and Conyers Middleton she was a great
favourite. Her nephew and adopted son, in his volumes
of her letters<a id="1_FNanchor_8" href="#1_Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 8">[8]</a> that he published in 1810, states—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Her uncommon sensibility and acuteness of understanding,
as well as extraordinary beauty as a child,
rendered her an object of great notice in the University,
and Dr. Middleton was in the habit of requiring from
her an account of the learned conversations at which, in
his society, she was frequently present; not admitting
of the excuse of her tender age as a disqualification, but
insisting that although at the present time she could but
imperfectly understand their meaning, she would in
future derive great benefit from the habit of attention
inculcated by this practice.”</p>

in as large a measure as himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In her youth her beauty was most admired in the

distinguished scholars. We are told—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Their emulation produced a corresponding zeal in
their sisters, and a diligence of application unusual in
females of that time. Their domestic circle was
accustomed to struggle for the mastery in wit, or in
superiority in argument, and their mother, whose frame
of mind partook rather of the gentle sedateness of good
sense than of the eccentricities of genius, was denominated
by them ‘the Speaker,’ from the frequent mediation
by which she moderated their eagerness for
victory.”</p>

LADY MARGARET CAVENDISH HARLEY</div>

<p>In <cite>Harris’s “History of Kent,”</cite> published in 1719, on
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 156, is a picture of Mount Morris, the home of the
Robinsons, a large square house with a cupola surmounted
by a ball and a weathercock, surrounded by
a number of walled gardens laid out in the formal
Dutch manner, an inner Topiary garden, leading to a
steep flight of steps to the front door. Whilst staying
in Cambridgeshire, Elizabeth had several times visited
at Wimpole with her father and mother. Wimpole
was the seat of Edward,<a id="1_FNanchor_9" href="#1_Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 9">[9]</a> second Earl of Oxford and
Mortimer, who had married Henrietta Cavendish, only
daughter and heiress of John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
She was a great heiress, and brought
her husband £500,000; she is said to have been a good
but a very dull woman, very proud, and a rigid worshipper
of etiquette. In the “<cite>National Biography</cite>” she
is said to have “disliked most of the wits who surrounded
her husband, and hated <em>Pope</em>!”<a id="1_FNanchor_10" href="#1_Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 10">[10]</a> The Earl spent
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_8">[8]</span>enormous sums in collecting books, manuscripts, pictures,
medals, and articles of virtu, spending £400,000 of his
wife’s fortune. To him we are indebted for the Harleian
manuscripts, bought from his widow in 1753 for £10,000
by the nation, now in the British Museum. With the
Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley,<a id="1_FNanchor_11" href="#1_Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 11">[11]</a> only child of the
Earl and Countess of Oxford, Elizabeth became on
the most intimate terms, and her first extant letter is
addressed to her when she was only eleven years old,
and the Lady Margaret eighteen. So greatly did Lady
Margaret value Elizabeth’s letters, that for a series of
years she preserved them between the leaves of an old
grey book which I possess. The first letter is endorsed,
“Received, February 24, 1731–2, at Wimpole.” It commences—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“Your ladyship’s commands always give me a

as great impertinence in me to have attempted it as it is

<p>The formal terms in this letter were then considered
essential, even when addressing those of lower birth,
all the more so to a person of Lady Margaret’s rank.
Viscount Dupplin, whose name frequently occurs in the
letters, was a cousin of Lady Margaret’s on her father’s
side, his mother being a daughter of Robert Harley,
1st Earl of Oxford. The two young friends now kept
up a lively correspondence, but as many of the letters
have been published by my grandfather in 1810, I shall
for this early period of her life give only a <i>résumé</i> of
them, picking out such facts as point to the manners of
the time, or that strike one as of interest. From Mount
Morris in August, 1732, she writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since I came here I have been to Canterbury Races,
at which there was not much diversion, as only one
horse ran for the King’s Plate.... We had an assembly
for three nights; the rooms are so small and low that
they were exceedingly hot.”</p>
</div>

<p>From this date one perceives that young ladies were
allowed to appear in public early, as Elizabeth was then
not quite twelve years old!</p>

<div class="year">1733</div>

<div class="sidenote">TUNBRIDGE WELLS</div>

<p>In October, 1733, she paid, in company of her parents,
her first visit to Tunbridge Wells, ever afterwards such
a favourite resort of hers. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is so pleasant a place I don’t wonder the physicians
prescribe it as a cure for the spleen; a great part of the
company, especially of the gentlemen, are vapoured.
When the wind is not in the east they are very good
company, but they are as afraid of an easterly wind as if
it would bring caterpillars upon our land as it did on the
land of Egypt.... I am very sorry I could not get you
any verses at Tunbridge, of which, at the latter part of
the season, when the garrets grow cheap, that the poets
come down, there is commonly great plenty.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>Further on she says, “I thank your ladyship for the
verses, and I wish I had any to send you in return for
them, but my poet is turned lawyer, and has forsook
the Muses for ‘Coke upon Littleton.’” This alludes
to her brother Tom, who was then studying law. The

<p>In the next letter of November, 1733, she alludes
to Dr. Conyers Middleton, who, as stated before, had
married Mrs. Drake, Elizabeth’s grandmother, and who
was now a widower—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I suppose you have heard Dr. Middleton has
brought his Cousin Place<a id="1_FNanchor_14" href="#1_Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 14">[14]</a> to keep his house. He very
gravely sent us word that his cousin had come to spend
the winter with him, and it was not impossible they
might agree for a longer time; so I fancy he has
brought her with him to see if she likes to play at
quadrille, and sup on sack posset with the grave
doctors, whose company to one of her gay temper must
be delightful. I suspected his designs when he made
so many complaints in London, that it was so very
difficult to find a maid who understood making jellies
and sack posset, which he and a certain doctor used
to have for their suppers. He lost one lady because
she was deaf to him; but I believe that fortune, to
make amends to him, has blinded this. For though
I don’t doubt he always takes care to show her the
side of his face which Mr. Doll says is younger by
ten years than the other, yet that is rather too old to
be a match for twenty-five, which I believe is the age of
Mrs.<a id="1_FNanchor_15" href="#1_Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 15">[15]</a> Place.”</p>

<p>The next letter she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have not heard from Dr. Middleton a great while.
I suppose his thoughts are taken up with business and
his pretty cousin in the West. I don’t know whether
she has made a complete conquest of his heart.”</p>
</div>

<p>In May, 1733—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Middleton now owns his marriage. I wish he
finds the felicity of it answers his resigning a £100 a
year. I am glad, for the sake of any other family, he
has not got another rich widow; if he had, it would have
been her turn to resign.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. ROBINSON</div>

<p>Mr. Robinson, Elizabeth’s father, was not fond of the
country, where his wife’s fine estate and his nine children
condemned him to reside the greater part of the year;
and when we consider how young a man he was, then
only thirty-one, and his great love of witty society, one
cannot be surprised at his having attacks of the “hyp”
or “vapours,” as the terms for ennui were then. Elizabeth
writes to Lady Margaret from Mount Morris—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Though I am tired of the country, to my great
satisfaction I am not so much so as my Pappa; he is a
little vapoured, and last night, after two hours’ silence,
he broke out with a great exclamation against the
country, and concluded in saying that living in the
country was sleeping with one’s eyes open. If he sleeps
all day, I am sure he dreams much of London. What
makes this place more dull is, my brothers are none of
them here; two of them went away about a fortnight
ago, and ever since my Pappa has ordered me to put a
double quantity of saffron<a id="1_FNanchor_16" href="#1_Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 16">[16]</a> in his tea.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUCHESS OF PORTLAND</div>

<p>On July 11, 1734, Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley
married William, 2nd Duke of Portland.<a id="1_FNanchor_17" href="#1_Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 17">[17]</a> There
are no letters of Elizabeth’s in my possession on the
occasion of her friend’s marriage; they recommence
October 20 in the same year. Henceforward all the
duchess’s letters were franked by the duke, and many
of Elizabeth’s, often unfortunately undated. At this
period ladies prevailed on such of their friends as
were either Peers or members of Parliament, to sign
sheets of letter-paper with their names at the back, often
of folio size, which they used free of cost as they wanted
them, wrapping their letters in these outer sheets and
sealing them. As a single letter from London to
Edinburgh cost 1<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i>, if double 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, and if treble
3<i>s.</i> 4½<i>d.</i>, the smallest inclosure being treated as an
additional sheet, to send letters unfranked was a costly
luxury. The practice of forging people’s names led to
such intolerable abuse of franking that an Act was
passed in 1764 making it compulsory for the whole
address to be written by the person franking the
letter.</p>

<p>“<i>Oct. 3, 1734.</i>—I am surprised that my answer to

sent it immediately to Canterbury by the servant of a

would be the mortification, that instead of having the
honour to kiss your Grace’s hands, it must lie confined
in the footman’s pocket with greasy gloves, rotten
apples, a pack of dirty cards, and the only companion of
its sort, a tender epistle from his sweetheart, ‘tru tell
deth.’ Perhaps by its situation subject to be kicked by
his master every morning, till at last, by ill-usage and
rude company, worn too thin for any other use, it may
make its exit in lighting a tobacco-pipe. I believe the
fellow who lost my letter knew very well how ready I

This was due to her vivacity of mind and body. She
was never really a strong person, but her nervous
energy enabled her frail body to perform feats that a

marriage to a country dance, which scheme I

would. I danced twice a week all the time I was at
Tunbridge, and once extraordinary, for Lord Euston<a id="1_FNanchor_25" href="#1_Footnote_25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 25">[25]</a>

but her Grace went home early, and then Lord Euston
danced with Lady Delves. We all left off about one
o’clock. The day after I left the Wells, I went to the
Races (Canterbury), which began on Monday, and ended
on Thursday.... Monday there was an Assembly,
Tuesday a Play, Wednesday an Assembly again, and
Thursday another play, and as soon as that was over,
we had a ball where we had ten couple. I did not go to

<p>“Yesterday I was overturned coming from a neighbour’s.
We got no hurt at all, but were forced to borrow
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_20">[20]</span>a coach to bring us the rest of the way, our own being
quite disabled by the fall.... I always think one visits
in the country at the hazard of one’s bones, but fear is
never so powerful with me, as to make me stay at home,
and the next thing to being retired, is to be morose:
contemplation is not made for a woman on the right
side of thirty, it suits prodigiously well with the gout or
the rheumatism: rest and an elbow chair are the comfort
of age, but the pleasures of youth are of a more lively
sort. I have in winter gone eight miles to dance to the
music of a blind fiddler, and returned at two in the
morning, mightily pleased that I had been so well entertained.
I am so fond of dancing that I cannot help
fancying I was at some time bit by a tarantula,<a id="1_FNanchor_35" href="#1_Footnote_35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 35">[35]</a> and

THE PLAY</div>

<p>In the next letter to the duchess, October 15, 1737—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lady Thanet made a ball at Hothfield a few days
ago to which she did our family the honour to invite
them, and as we were obeying her commands and got
into the coach with our ball airs and our dancing shoes,
at five miles of our journey we met with a brook so
swelled by the rain it looked like a river, and the water,
we were told, was up to the coach seat, and as I had
never heard of any balls in the Elysian Fields, and don’t
so much as know whether the ghosts of departed beaux
wear pumps, I thought it better to reserve ourselves for
the Riddotto<a id="1_FNanchor_36" href="#1_Footnote_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 36">[36]</a> than hazard drowning for this ball, and
so we turned back and went to Sir Wyndham Knatchbull’s,<a id="1_FNanchor_37" href="#1_Footnote_37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 37">[37]</a>
who were hindered by the same water; for my
part I could think of nothing but the ball, when any one
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_21">[21]</span>asked me how I did I cry’d tit for tat, and when they
bid me sit down, I answered ‘Jack of the green.’ A few
days after the ball, Lady Thanet bespoke a play at a
town eight miles from us, and summoned us to it; two
of my brothers, and my sister,<a id="1_FNanchor_38" href="#1_Footnote_38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 38">[38]</a> and your humble servant
went, and after the play the gentlemen invited all the
women to a supper at a tavern, where we staid till two
o’clock in the morning, and then all set out for their
respective homes. Here I suppose you will think my
diversion ended, but I must tell your Grace it did not;
for before I had gone two miles, I had the pleasure of
being overturned, at which I squalled for joy; and to
complete my felicity I was obliged to stand half an hour
in the most refreshing rain, and the coolest north breeze
I ever felt; for the coach’s braces breaking were the
occasion of our overturn, and there was no moving till
they were mended. You may suppose we did not lose
so favourable an opportunity of catching cold; we all
came croaking down to breakfast the next morning, and
said we had caught no cold, as one always says when
one has been scheming, but I think I have scarce recovered
my treble notes yet. We had seven coaches at
the play; there was Lord Winchilsea,<a id="1_FNanchor_39" href="#1_Footnote_39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 39">[39]</a> Lady Charlotte
Finch,<a id="1_FNanchor_40" href="#1_Footnote_40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 40">[40]</a> Lady Betty Fielding,<a href="#1_Footnote_40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 40">[40]</a> Capt.

and the Miss Palmers.<a id="1_FNanchor_42" href="#1_Footnote_42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 42">[42]</a> Mr. Fielding and Miss Molly
Palmer caught such colds they sent for a physician the
next day; Lady Knatchbull and Miss Knatchbull have
kept their beds ever since: poor Lady Thanet was overturned
as she went home, and caught a terrible hoarseness,
which was the better for the poor coachman, who
by that means escaped a sharp and shrill reproof; and
indeed it is enough for any poor man to lye under the
terror of her frowns, with a look she can wound, with a
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_22">[22]</span>frown she can kill; I think I never saw so formidable a
countenance. I think Lord Thanet’s education of his
son<a id="1_FNanchor_43" href="#1_Footnote_43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 43">[43]</a> is something particular; he encourages him in
swearing and singing nasty ballads with the servants:
he is a very fine boy, but prodigiously rude; he came
down to breakfast the other day when there was company,
and his maid came with him, who, instead of
carrying a Dutch toy, or a little whirligig for his Lordship
to play with, was lugging a billet for his plaything.
There was a fine supper at the ball, 33 dishes all very
neat. My elder brother got out of the coach and put on
a pair of boots, and rode on to the ball when we turned
back.”</p>

<p>At this period, though undated, may be placed Elizabeth’s
request to her father for a handsome suit of
clothes. In a letter to her mother she thanks her “for
your goodness in giving me leave to stay, and making it
convenient to answer the Duchess’s and my wishes to
stay during her confinement. When we came to town
the Duchess reckoned the end of April.” From Bullstrode,
therefore, she accompanied the duchess and her
family to Whitehall, where in a portion of the old palace
was the Portlands’ town residence. Elizabeth was now
in her eighteenth year. In a letter to her father, too
lengthy to insert entirely, worded in the respectful
way children addressed their parents then, with “Sir”
and “Madam,” and concluding with “your most dutiful
daughter,” she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You know this year I am to be introduced by the
Duchess to the best company in the town, and when she
lies in, am both to receive in form with her all her visits
as Lady Bell<a id="1_FNanchor_46" href="#1_Footnote_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 46">[46]</a> used to do on that occasion, all the people
of quality of both sexes that are in London, and I must
be in full dress, and shall go about with her all the
winter, therefore a suit of cloathes will be necessary for
me, the value of which I submit entirely to you. I shall
never so much want a handsome suit as upon this occasion
of first appearing with my Lady Duchess; but as
the first consideration is to please you, I would by no
means urge this beyond your pleasure, by duty or inclination,
I shall always be content with what you order,
and hope you will not be displeased with my requests.”</p>

bosom friend, vanity, which, though it does not abandon
me in a plain gown, takes greater delight in seeing me

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> April 16, 1738, the Duchess of Portland’s son,
William Henry, afterwards 3rd Duke, was born, after
which Elizabeth returned home with her father. On
June 30 the duchess wrote to apologize for a long
silence—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I should have answered dear Fidget’s letter before
I left London, but you are sensible what a hurry one
lives in there, and particularly after being confined some
months from public diversions, how much one is engaged
in them, Operas, Park, Assemblies, Vaux Hall—which
I believe you never had the occasion of seeing. You
must get your Papa to stay next year: it is really insufferable
going out of town at the most pleasant time
of the year. I am positive the easterly winds have
much greater effect upon the spirits in the country,
than it is possible they should have in London. I
dare say the chief part of the year your Papa is in town
he don’t know which way the wind is, except when he
goes into a Coffee House and meets with some poor
disbanded Officer who is quarrelling with the times
and consequently with the weather, because he is not a
General in time of peace; or a valetudinarian, that if a
fly settled on his nose, would curse the Easterly wind,
and fancy it had sent it there; these are the only people
that ever thought of East wind in London.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_27">[27]</span></p>
<p>At the end of the letter the duchess says, “My
amusements are all of the Rural kind—Working, Spinning,
Knotting, Drawing, Reading, Writing, Walking,
and picking Herbs to put into an Herbal.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR ROBERT AUSTIN</div>

<p>This little peep of her life is most characteristic,
though fond of the pleasures of high society diversions,
and the varieties of London, she took an interest in all
sorts of country and domestic pursuits, and excelled in
them. She turned in wood and ivory; she was familiar
with every kind of needlework; she made shell frames,
adorned grottoes, designed feather work, collected
endless objects in the animal and vegetable kingdom;
was a hearty lover of animals and birds of all kinds.
Her letters are lively and affectionate, but not clever
and witty as her friend Elizabeth Robinson’s. She
complains of her stupidity in letter-writing. Elizabeth
had the witty head, and the duchess the cunning hand,
but both possessed that valuable possession, warm
hearts. To the duchess’s last letter Elizabeth replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I arrived at Mount Morris rather more fond of
society than solitude. I thought it no very agreeable

a lady may make her lover languish till he is the size
she most likes ... as it is the fashion for men to die for

THE GOAT</div>

<p>On December 17 Elizabeth writes to the duchess
in answer to a string of queries the latter had sent
her—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I must take the liberty to advise what is to be done,
and to avoid confusion will take them in the order of
the letter. Item, for the wet-nurse<a id="1_FNanchor_51" href="#1_Footnote_51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 51">[51]</a> after the chickenpox,
that she may become new milch again, a handful of
Camomile flowers, a handful of Pennyroyal, boiled in

going to rest. For my Lord Titchfield who grows
prodigiously, Daisy roots and milk. For the small
foot and taper ancle of my Lady Duchess, bruised and
strained by a fall, a large shoe and oil Opodeldock.
For the horse whose Christian name I have forgotten,
Friar’s Balsam, and for the death of a dormouse take
four of the fairest Moral and Theological Virtues, with
patience and fortitude, quantum sufficit, and they will
prevent immoderate grieving.... I heard a very ridiculous
story a few days ago: Mr. Page, brother to Sir
Gregory, going to visit Mr. Edward Walpole,<a id="1_FNanchor_52" href="#1_Footnote_52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 52">[52]</a> a tame
goat which was in the street followed him unperceived
when he got out of the coach into the house. Mr.
Walpole’s servant, thinking the goat came out of Mr.
Page’s coach, carried it into the room to Mr. Walpole,
who thought it a little odd Mr. Page should bring such a
visitor, as Mr. Page no less admired at his choice of so
savoury a companion; but civility, a great disguiser of
sentiments, prevented their declaring their opinions, and
the goat, no respecter of persons or furniture, began to
rub himself against the frame of a chair which was
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_29">[29]</span>carved and gilt, and the chair, which was fit for a
Christian, but unable to bear the shock of a beast, fell
almost to pieces. Mr. Walpole thought Mr. Page very
indulgent to his dear crony the goat, and wondering he
took no notice of the damage, said he fancied tame goats
did a great deal of harm, to which the other said he
believed so too: after much free and easy behaviour of
the goat, to the great detriment of the furniture, they
came to an explanation, and Mr. Goat was turned downstairs
with very little ceremony or good manners....
Dr. Middleton has got two nieces whom he is to keep
entirely, for his brother left them quite destitute. They
are very fine children, and my Grannam is very fond of
them. The doctor is soon to bring forth his ‘<cite>Cicero</cite>,’
everybody says the production will do him credit. Lady
Thanet has set an assembly on foot about eight miles from
hence, where we all meet at the full moon and dance till
12 o’clock, and then take an agreeable journey home.
Our assembly in full glory has ten coaches at it; and
Lady Thanet, to make up a number, is pleased in her
humility to call in all the parsons, apprentices, tradesmen,
apothecaries, and farmers, milliners, mantua-makers,
haberdashers of small wares, and chambermaids. It is
the oddest mixture you can imagine—here sails a reverent
parson, there skips an airy apprentice, here jumps a
farmer, and then every one has an eye to their trade;
the milliner pulls you by the hand till she tears your
glove; the mantua-maker treads upon your petticoat
till she unrips the seams; the shoemaker makes you
foot it till you wear out your shoes; the mercer dirties
your gown; the apothecary opens the window behind
you to make you sick. Most of our neighbours will be
in town by the next moon, so we shall have no more
balls this winter. In town the ladies talk of their stars,
but here, ‘If weak women go astray, the moon is more
in fault than they.’ Will o’ Whisp never led the
bewildered traveller over hedge or ditch as a moon
does us country folk; a squeaking fiddle is an occasion,
and a moonlight night an opportunity, to go ten miles in<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_30">[30]</span>
bad roads at any time. I must tell your Grace that my
Papa forgets twenty years and nine children, and dances
as nimbly as any of the Quorum, but is now and then
mortified by hearing the ladies cry, ‘Old Mr. Robinson
hay sides, and turn your daughter:’ other ladies who
have a mind to appear young say, ‘Well, there is my
poor Grandpapa; he could no more dance so.’ Then
comes an old bachelor of fifty and shakes him by the
hand, and cries, ‘Why you dance like us young fellows:’
another more injudicious than the rest, says by way of
compliment, ‘Who would think you had six fine children
taller than yourself? I protest if I did not know you
I should take you to be young.’ Then says the most
antiquated Virgin in the company, ‘Mr. Robinson wears
mighty well; my mother says he looks as well as ever
she remembers him; he used often to come to the house
when I was a girl.’ You may suppose he has not the
‘hyp’ at these balls; but indeed it is a distemper so well
bred as never to come but when people are at home and

<p>In April, 1739, Elizabeth’s cousin, Grace Robinson,

Freind, Head Master of Westminster School. Soon
after the marriage, Elizabeth, who appears to have known
Mr. Freind intimately before he married her cousin,
writes from “Leicester Street, near Leicester Fields,”
to Mr. and Mrs. Freind, “How rare meet now, such
pairs in love and honour joyn’d,” and addresses them as
“my inestimable cousins.” She states that her family
return to Kent shortly, whilst she is going to the
Duchess of Portland in White Hall. Elizabeth writes
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_31">[31]</span>to the duchess on July 1, 1739, having just returned
home from her visit—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

hear the most elegant encomiums upon the country, and
the most barbarous censures upon the town. First his
Worship talked of Larks and Nightingales, then enlarged
upon the sweetness of bean blossom, roses and honeysuckles,
said the town stunk of cabbages and limekilns,
so that I found as to pleasures he was lead by the nose.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“The great art of life is to turn our misfortunes
to our advantage, and to make even disappointments
instrumental to our pleasures. To follow which rule I
have taken the day which I should have gone to the
Races to write to your Grace. About ten days ago my
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_32">[32]</span>Papa took an hypochondriacal resolution not to go to
the Races, for the Vapours and Love are two things
that seek solitude, but for me, who have neither in my
constitution, a crowd is not disagreeable, and I always
find myself prompted by a natural benevolence and
love of Society to go where two or three are gathered
together.... The theory of dancing is extreamly odd,
tho’ the practice is agreeable; who could by force of
reasoning find out the satisfaction of casting off right
hand and left, and the Hayes; we often laugh at a kitten
turning round in pursuit of its tail, when the creature is
really turning single. I shall have an account of the
Races from my brother Robinson, who is there; as for
the Barrister,<a id="1_FNanchor_55" href="#1_Footnote_55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 55">[55]</a> he came down to the Sessions, and when
he had sold all his Law, packed up his saleable eloquence
and carried it back to Lincoln’s Inn, there to be left till
called for. Would you think a person so near akin to me
as a brother could run away from a ball? I hear some
Canterbury girls who could aspire no higher than a
younger brother, are very angry, and say they shall never
put their cause into his hands, as he seems so little
willing to defend it.... Next year we must certainly
go to the Races for the good of the county, and dance out
of the spirit of Patriotism. The Election year always
brings company to Canterbury upon this occasion, and
as for me I will dance to either a Whig or a Tory tune,
as it may be, for in any wise I will dance. I am not like
the dancing Monkies who will only cut their capers for
King George, I will dance for any man or Monarch in
Christendom, nay were it even a Mahometan or idolatrous
King; I should not make much scruple about it. I had
the misfortune to be overturned the other day coming
from Sir Wyndham Knatchbull’s,<a id="1_FNanchor_56" href="#1_Footnote_56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 56">[56]</a> the occasion of it
was one of our wheels coming off. I assure you I but
just avoided the indecency of being topsy turvey, my
head was so much lower than its usual situation, as put
my ideas much out of place, and I think my head has<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_33">[33]</span>
been in a perfect litter ever since.... I shall begin to
think from my frequent overturns a bone-setter a
necessary part of equipage for country visiting. I am
sure those who visit much, love their neighbours better
than themselves; perhaps you will be as apt to suspect
me as anybody of that extream of charity, but I am so
tender of myself there are few I would hazard even a
gristle or a sinew, but civility is a debt that must be

<div class="sidenote">DUKE OF PORTLAND</div>

<p>The duchess was now expecting her confinement,
and Lady Wallingford, who was staying with her,
corresponded with Elizabeth in French. Owing to
the residence of her father in France as Superintendent
of Finances, she was more French than English.
Her letters are well written and expressed, though the
spelling is peculiar. At a later date she writes to
Elizabeth in broken English, and she scolds her for
making her correspond in English instead of French.
Horace Walpole, in a letter to the Earl of Buchan,
states that Lady Wallingford was the image of her
father, and that her mother, Lady Katherine Law, lived
during her husband’s power in France in great state.
On July 26, 1739, another daughter, Lady Margaret, was
born to the duchess. Dr. Sandys was, as usual, the
accoucheur, but it makes one horrified in these days to
think Dr. Sandys <em>bled</em> the duchess for a feverish cold
on the Monday and Thursday after her child was born.
Truly under this San Grado treatment it was then
the “survival of the fittest”! The duke now wrote a
bulletin of his wife to Elizabeth—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<div class="signed">“<span class="smcap">Portland</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p>The duke’s writing is very characteristic, but certainly
rather disjointed looking, and his I’s always
written as long j’s.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had just had another coach adventure.
The coachman who drove her father and mother and
her brother Matthew home after dining at a neighbour’s,
was drunk, which they did not perceive till he lashed
the four horses into a furious gallop. In vain Mr.
Robinson called to him, and swore at him; Matthew and
Mrs. Robinson intreated; he persisted in lashing the
horses till he fell off the box, and two wheels ran over
him, but as Elizabeth states, “being preserved in beer,
took very little harm; both footmen were drunk, so took
very little care about us.”</p>

<p>In a letter to the duchess (August 15) we find
Elizabeth and her sister Sarah banished from home to
Canterbury on account of a woman and three children<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_35">[35]</span>
who lived in a farmhouse near the gate of Mount
Morris having the smallpox. That fell disease ever
inspired Elizabeth with great dread. Later in life at
three different times she was inoculated,<a id="1_FNanchor_57" href="#1_Footnote_57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 57">[57]</a> each time unsuccessfully,
for this disease, then a universal scourge.
I should like the foolish fathers and mothers of the
present day who petition for non-vaccination to read the
accounts given in letters I possess of the unbridled
ravages then made by smallpox, and to consider that a
usually temporary inconvenience to the child’s health is
a very trifling infliction compared with a loathsome
disease, which many people fled from nursing, and
which even if it did not kill the sufferers, probably disfigured
them for life. The sisters first stayed with Mrs.
Scott,<a id="1_FNanchor_58" href="#1_Footnote_58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 58">[58]</a> and then with Mrs. Tennison, “wife to a prebend
in this church; there is very little company here,
except Deans, Prebends and Minor Canons, etc., etc.;
nothing but messages and visits from Prebends, Deacons,
and the Church militant upon earth.” Later on, speaking
of her brother Matthew’s refusal to leave home on
account of the smallpox, she says, “I have seven
brothers, and would not part with one for a kingdom;
and if I had but one, I should be distracted about him;
sure nobody has so many or so good brothers.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">INFLUENZA —<br>
THE SMALLPOX</div>

<p>Meanwhile the duchess had a return of fever, and
was for some days in great danger. On August 28
Lady Wallingford writes to say she was out of danger.
Influenza was rife then, and Lady Wallingford states
that she had not a single lackey fit to attend her from
her house to Whitehall, but had walked there by herself,
though still suffering from its effects. It was not then
called influenza, but from the description must have<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_36">[36]</span>
been that disease. Eight out of the nine in the farm
at Mount Morris caught the smallpox, and the duke,
writing to Elizabeth on September 15, a bulletin about
his wife, adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Both she and j<a id="1_FNanchor_59" href="#1_Footnote_59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 59">[59]</a> join in entreating you not to venture
yourself, and that pretty face of yours, to come within
the walls of your paternal mansion, and were j in your
situation, nothing but absolute commands should make
me venture myself.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>After her visit to Canterbury, Elizabeth spent a
month at Mersham Hatch with the Knatchbulls. She
now became seriously indisposed; her health was always
frail, and she appears to have suffered much from headaches
at this period. In a letter to the duchess she
complains—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have swallowed the weight of an Apothecary in
medicine, and what I am the better for it, except more
patient, and less credulous, I know not. I have learnt
to bear my infirmities and not to trust to the skill of
Physicians for curing them. I endeavour to drink
deeply of Philosophy, and to be wise when I cannot be
merry, easy when I cannot be glad, content with what
cannot be mended, and patient where there be no
redress. The mighty can do no more, and the wise
seldom do as much.”</p>
</div>

<p>On October 10 she announces that she and her
mother, who had been extremely unwell too, had been
advised to drink the Bath waters, and were to be
accompanied there by her father. She hopes to see the
duchess on her way to Bath, but bids her tell her porter
to admit her, as she has grown so thin—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“he will think it is my ghost and shut the door. I
shall stay but a few days in town and then proceed with<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_37">[37]</span>
my Father and Mother, to the waters of life and
recovery. My Pappa’s chimney ‘hyp’ will never
venture to attack him in a public place; it is the sweet
companion of solitude and the off-spring of meditation,
the disease of an idle imagination, not the child of hurry
and diversion. I am afraid that with the gaiety of the
place, and the spirits the waters give, I shall be perfect
Sal-Volatile, and open my mouth and evaporate.... I
was a month at Hatch, where the good humour of the
family makes everything agreeable; we had great variety
in the house—children in cradles, and old women in
elbow chairs. I think the family may be looked upon
as the three tenses, the present, past and future.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">COTTAGE LIFE</div>

<p>On a fresh scare being caused by the illness of her
maid, which the old women of the parish pronounced
to be smallpox, Mrs. Robinson sent Elizabeth and Sarah
to the cottage of the carpenter hard by without delay,
though so late that Elizabeth writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I arrived at my new lodging but the moment
before it was time to go to bed, where I slept pretty
well, notwithstanding the goodman and his wife snored,
the little child cryed, the maid screamed, one little boy
had whooping cough, another roared with chilblains.
The furniture of our chamber is extraordinary, the
ornamental parts as follows:—on the mantelpiece four
stone tea-cups, four wineglasses, two broken, two
leaden cherubims, a piece of looking-glass, with a
‘beggerly account of empty bottles,’ as Shakespeare
calls it, a print of King Charles the Martyr, the woeful
ballad of the children in the wood, a pious copy of
verses entitled ‘the believer’s gold chain, or good
councell for all men,’ with a resplendent brass warming
pan, in which my sister is dressing her head to the disadvantage
of her complexion, and not much to the
rectitude of her head-dress.”</p>
</div>

<p>The alarm proved to be false as to the nature of<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_38">[38]</span>
the maid’s illness, and they returned the next day to
the paternal mansion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EDMUND CURLL</div>

<p>On November 12 Elizabeth writes from Bath to her
sister a long and indignant letter upon some poems
brought out in the name of Prior. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I got at last this morning the poems just published

<p>She continues to inveigh against this forgery in
eloquent terms, and towards the end of the letter remarks
“that mankind can’t support above two dead languages
at a time, so as to have any tolerable knowledge
or use of them, therefore in all probability Shakespeare,
Milton, Dryden, Prior, and Pope are but short-lived, in

DOWAGER DUCHESS OF NORFOLK</div>

<p>Miss Anne Donnellan, who according to the then prevailing
custom in regard to unmarried women beyond
extreme youth was called Mrs., was the daughter of
Nehemiah Donnellan, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer
of Ireland, and Martha, <i>née</i> Miss Usher. Her father was
dead, and her mother had, in 1712, remarried the <abbr title="Honourable">Hon.</abbr>
Philip Percival, brother to the 1st Lord Egmont. The
Donnellans were great friends of Dean Swift, and Anne
and her brother, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Christopher Donnellan, were
correspondents of his, as can be seen in the printed letters
in “<cite>Swift’s Life</cite>.” The next letter to the duchess says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lord Berkshire was wheeled into the rooms on
Thursday night, where he saluted me with much snuff
and civility, in consequence of which I sneezed and
curtseyed abundantly; as a further demonstration of his
loving-kindness, he made me play at commerce with him.
You may easily guess at the charms of a place where
the height of my happiness is a pair royal at commerce,
and a peer of fourscore. Last night I took to the more
youthful diversion of dancing, and am nothing but a fan
(which my partner tore), the worse for it; our beaux
here may make a rent in a woman’s fan, but they never
will make holes in her heart, for my part Lord Noel
Somerset<a id="1_FNanchor_77" href="#1_Footnote_77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 77">[77]</a> has made me a convert from toupets and
pumps, to tye wigs and a gouty shoe. Ever since my
Lord Duke reprimanded me for admiring Lord Crawford’s<a id="1_FNanchor_78" href="#1_Footnote_78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 78">[78]</a>
nimble legs, I have resolved to prefer the merit
of the head to the agility of the heels; and I have made
so great a progress in my resolution as to like the good
sense which limps, better than the lively folly which
dances. But to my misfortune he likes the Queen of
Spades so much more than me, that he never looks off
his cards, though, were I the Queen of Diamonds, he
would stand a fair chance for me. Lord Aylesford
comes to the rooms every night like ‘Beau Clincher’ in<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_42">[42]</span>
a blanket: he wears a nasty red rugg great coat. The
Dowager Duchess of Norfolk bathes, and being very tall
she had like to have drowned a few women in the Cross
Bath, for she ordered it to be filled till it reached to her
chin, and so all those who were below her stature, as
well as rank, were forced to come out or drown; and
finding, according to the Proverb, in vain to strive
against the stream, they left the bath rather than swallow
so large a draught of water. I am sorry for the cruel
separation of your Grace and Miss Dashwood, I believe
no one parts with their friends with greater reluctance
than you do.”</p>

<p>“I think Lord Noel’s wife must be happy, and Miss
Berkeley is a very deserving woman, and good-natured.
Everybody is content except those who would have
liked the gentleman for themselves.... A man of merit,
and a younger brother is a purchase only for a large
fortune; as for those who have more merit than wealth,
they must turn the penny by disposing of their useless
virtues for riches, the exchange may sometimes be
difficult, Virtues not being sterling, nor merit the coin
of the nation.... Gold is the chief ingredient in the
composition of worldly happiness. Living in a cottage
on love is certainly the worst diet and the worst habitation
one can find out. As for modern marriages they
are great infringers of the baptismal vow; for ’tis
commonly the pomps and vanities of this wicked world
on one side and the simple lust of the flesh on the other
side. For my part when I marry I do not intend to
enlist entirely under the banner of Cupid or Plutus, but
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_43">[43]</span>take prudent consideration and decent inclination for

<p>In January, 1740, the weather was so severe, a frost
fair was held on the Thames for weeks together; booths,
tents, and shows of all kinds were the order of the
day. In a letter to the duchess this is alluded to
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What will the world come to now the Duchesses
drink gin, and frequent Fairs? I am afraid your gentlemen
did not pledge you, or they might have resisted the
frost and the fatigue by the strength of that comfortable
liquor. I want much to know if your Grace got a ride
in the Flying Coach, which is part of the diversion of a
Fair.... I am much obliged to your Grace for forming
schemes for me. If any castles come to my share they
must be airy ones, for I have no material to build them
on Terra Firma. I am not a good chimerical architect,
and besides I would rather dwell this summer in a small
room in a certain mansion near Gerrard’s Cross,<a id="1_FNanchor_81" href="#1_Footnote_81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 81">[81]</a> than

<p>A letter from Mrs. Donnellan, with whom Elizabeth
had struck up a lively friendship, and entered into a<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_44">[44]</span>
correspondence, is dated from London, April, 1740,
portions of which I copy—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since my last I passed a most agreeable day with
your friend and mine; the Duke and Duchess of Portland
proposed a jaunt into the city to see city shows,
and were so obliging as to ask me with Mrs. Pendarves
to be of the party. We were four men, four women:
our fourth woman was Lady Wallingford, whom I never
saw before; but she seems good-natured and civil; our
four men, the Duke, Lord Dupplin, Mr. Achard,<a id="1_FNanchor_82" href="#1_Footnote_82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 82">[82]</a> and
Dr. Shaw,<a id="1_FNanchor_83" href="#1_Footnote_83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 83">[83]</a> all new to me. We set out at ten in two
hackney coaches, and stopped at everything that had a
name between us and the Tower, going and coming, and
dined at a city Tavern. I am extremely glad your time
is fixed for coming to us, and that we shall have you a
month. You will find the rage for whist<a id="1_FNanchor_84" href="#1_Footnote_84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 84">[84]</a> a little abated,
I hope, if the weather and Vaux Hall is in its lustre.
You are right in quarrelling with the men for letting
cards take their places in the ladies’ hearts, for I dare say
they would rather hear the gentlemen say fine things,
than win a Slam, and it is a want of gallantry in the
men that runs the women into cards; for something we
must have to stir our passions, or life seems dull. Your
account of Bath folks diverted me much.... My present
delight is the fine lady who admires and hates to excess;
she doats on the dear little boy that dances, she detests
Handel’s Oratorios; indeed she don’t say she admires
Mademoiselle de Chateauneuf’s kicking the tambourine,
till she shows herself naked to the waist. She owns it
is indecent, but she goes constantly to see her. I don’t
know whether you have heard of the kicking entertainment?
I have not seen it, but I have heard it very
lively described; she kicks twice for the King, and once<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_45">[45]</span>
for the audience, to the great edification of the spectators.
I suppose you have heard of the false dice at the last
masquerade. I fancy it must have been a pretty sight,
a dozen Dominoes, at five in the morning examined before
Justice de Val: I think they should have been all Devils
with Horns and Hoofs. I saw the Duke and Duchess of
Portland yesterday morning at Zincke’s,<a id="1_FNanchor_85" href="#1_Footnote_85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 85">[85]</a> where she and

<div class="sidenote">THE PLUNGE BATH</div>

<p>Elizabeth suffering much still from headaches, Dr.
Sandys was consulted, and he recommended the plunge
bath. This was at Marylebone, at the then popular
gardens. This was considered a hazardous exploit, and
she first wrote to ask her parents’ consent. Writing to
Sarah, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If you was to see me souse into the cold bath, you
would think I had not sense or feeling.... The Duchess
went with me the first time, and was frightened out
of her wits, but I behaved much to my honour. Mrs.
Verney went to learn to go in of me. Mrs. Pendarves
went with me to-day, and was as pale as a ghost with
the fear of my being drowned, which you know is impossible.
I go in every day and have found benefit
already; but there are two things I dislike, viz. the
pain of going overhead, and the expense of the bath.
The Duke and Duchess are very good in lending me
the coach every morning to Marrybone, which is two
miles from here, but the bath was better than any at
Charing Cross: the Duchess says if there is any bath,
as she thinks there is in their neighbourhood at Bullstrode,
she will send me to it, a tub not being near so
good.”</p>

chosen by their fans, but a little supercherie in the case
of one of our dancers appointed failed, so our worthy

her, but Mr. Hay,<a id="1_FNanchor_93" href="#1_Footnote_93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 93">[93]</a> who as the more canonical diversion,
chose cards, danced with the poor forsaken damsel.
The Knight bore the roast with great fortitude, and to
make amends promised his neglected Fair a ball at his
house. I believe in his economy he saves a dinner
when invited to supper, for he eat a forequarter of lamb,
a chicken, with a plentiful portion of ham, potted beef
and jellies innumerable, and made a prodigious breakfast
of bread and butter and coffee, a little after two in

Wallingford certainly caught his death with attending
her, a sad aggravation of the affliction; he died with the
greatest courage imaginable. Sandys, who with several
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_49">[49]</span>Physicians and Surgeons was called in, begged him to
settle his affairs, upon which he made his will (that he
had by him, being very deficient in points of Law), and
took leave of his friends. There was no hopes from the
first, for this convulsive Quinsy is always mortal.”</p>
</div>

<p>In another she says he died of “cramp in the throat,”
which sounds more likely. It has been stated that Lord
Wallingford died in France, but his death occurred at
Whitehall.</p>

in June for Bullstrode.<a id="1_FNanchor_98" href="#1_Footnote_98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 98">[98]</a> In a letter of June 24 to
Mr. Freind and his wife, she says—</p>

<p>“The rural beauties of the place would persuade me
I was in the plains of Arcadia, but the magnificence of
the building under whose gilded roof I dwell, has a
pomp far beyond pastoral. We go to chapel twice a week,
and have sermons on Sunday, for his Grace of Portland
values the title of Christian above that of Duke, and
the chaplain may preach against every vice in fashion
without fear of offending either his Patron or Patroness.”</p>

LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU</div>

<p>On July 22 occurs this interesting letter to her
mother—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“Much visiting has of late hindered my writing
to you. My Lady Duchess does not care to spare me to
write except when she is so employed too, and the time
set apart for that is in the evening, and when we make
visits at any distance, it is late before we return, and
letters go from here between 10 and 11. When we first
came down, we supped at 9, but we found so early an
hour encroached too much upon our hours of writing,
so now we sup at 10, at which time the Duke comes
into the Duchess’s dressing-room,<a id="1_FNanchor_99" href="#1_Footnote_99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 99">[99]</a> where we write
together, and franks our packets. On Saturday, we
were at Windsor to visit the Miss Granvilles, daughters
of the famous Lord Lansdowne;<a id="1_FNanchor_100" href="#1_Footnote_100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 100">[100]</a> they unhappily inherit
neither the wit of their Father, nor the beauty of their
Mother.<a id="1_FNanchor_101" href="#1_Footnote_101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 101">[101]</a>... The Duchess is very civil to them, and
Miss Granville was her acquaintance in infancy, and it
is very right in her to take notice of them now. Lord
Weymouth<a id="1_FNanchor_102" href="#1_Footnote_102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 102">[102]</a> supports them, but how long he will be
willing or able to do so, no one knows. On Sunday,
I was at Mrs. Hare’s, widow to the late Bishop Hare,<a id="1_FNanchor_103" href="#1_Footnote_103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 103">[103]</a>
and was much entertained there by Sir John Shadwell
and his family, who are just come from abroad. Lady
Shadwell<a id="1_FNanchor_104" href="#1_Footnote_104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 104">[104]</a> saw Lady Mary Wortley at Venice, where
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_51">[51]</span>she now resides, and asked her what made her leave
England; she told them the reason was, people were
grown so stupid she could not endure their company,
all England was infected with dullness; by-the-bye,
what she means by insupportable dullness is her
husband,<a id="1_FNanchor_105" href="#1_Footnote_105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 105">[105]</a> for it seems she never intends to come back
while he lives. A husband may be but a dull creature
to one of Lady Mary’s sprightly genius, but methinks
even her vivacity might accommodate itself to living
in the Kingdom with him; she is a woman of great
family merit, she has banished her children,<a id="1_FNanchor_106" href="#1_Footnote_106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 106">[106]</a> abandoned
her husband. I suppose as she cannot reach Constantinople,
she will limit her ambition to an intrigue with
the Pope or the Doge of Venice.... The Duke of
Leeds’<a id="1_FNanchor_107" href="#1_Footnote_107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 107">[107]</a> wedding was very grand. The Duke of Newcastle’s<a id="1_FNanchor_108" href="#1_Footnote_108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 108">[108]</a>
entertainment upon the occasion was 15 dishes
in a course, four courses. The Duchess of Newcastle,
sister to Lady Mary Godolphin, and Mr. Hay are gone
down with the Duke and Duchess of Leeds. The
Duchess had a diamond necklace from her Mother worth
£10,000, she was very fine in cloaths and jewels. The
old Duchess of Marlborough<a id="1_FNanchor_109" href="#1_Footnote_109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 109">[109]</a> is now mightily fond of
her. Her Grace is at law with the Duke of Marlbro’;
she talked two hours like the widow Blackacre in
Westminster Hall, amongst things of value she was to
surrender to the Duke<a id="1_FNanchor_110" href="#1_Footnote_110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 110">[110]</a> there was the late Duke’s fine
sword, and George, ‘Oh,’ says she, ‘as for the George,
he will sell it, but for the sword he won’t know what to
do with that, so I believe he will lay it by, or may be if
he can he will pawn it, he can make no other use of it, I
am sure.’... Pray have you heard from the dear little<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_52">[52]</span>

<p>Mr. Freind, having written a letter to Elizabeth
expressing a fear that her head might be turned by the
great company, and the splendid place she was residing
in, she replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am neither condemning greatness, nor envying it,
but gratefully and cheerfully enjoying what I am. I
thank Providence for the blessings it has given me,
without either despising or wishing for the gifts it has

regretting the past, or wishing for that to come, but still

hope for the future, and love this life without fearing
another.”</p>

<p>This letter was sent to Witney, Oxon, the seat
of the blanket manufacture. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Freind
had become Rector there, since the resignation of
his father, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Robert Freind, in the previous
year. His mother was a Miss Jane de l’Angle, daughter
of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel de l’Angle, once pastor of the reformed
church at Charenton, near Paris, who, on the
persecution of Louis XIV., fled to England and was
made a Prebendary of Westminster. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William
Freind built the good stone rectory still existent at
Witney. A medallion portrait of him is over a door
in the Hall. Mrs. Donnellan had been recommended

<div class="sidenote">LYDIA BOTHAM —<br>
COUNTESS OF OXFORD</div>

<p>This is the first allusion to Lydia Botham, cousin of
Elizabeth Robinson; she, and her more illustrious sister
Elizabeth, or Eliza Lumley, afterwards wife of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Laurence Sterne, of “Shandean” memory, were the
children of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Lumley, of the Lumley
Castle family, Rector of Bedale, Yorks, from 1721 to
1732; and of Lydia, daughter of Anthony Light,<a id="1_FNanchor_123" href="#1_Footnote_123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 123">[123]</a> and
widow in 1709 of her first husband, Thomas Kirke,
of Cockridge, near Leeds (a famous Virtuoso), she
married afterwards the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Lumley;<a id="1_FNanchor_124" href="#1_Footnote_124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 124">[124]</a> for the
table elucidating this pedigree the reader must turn to
the end of the introductory portion of this work. The
Lumleys are said to have been brought up in style, but
little means had remained to them. Both parents were
dead; Lydia had recently married the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Botham,
Rector of Yoxall, Staffordshire. Elizabeth Lumley, her
sister, was residing alone in “Little Alice Lane,” under
the shadow of York Cathedral. In a folio-sheet letter
to her sister Sarah, Elizabeth explains that owing to the
Countess of Oxford being at Bullstrode, she had more
time to herself, as the countess and she had spent
alternate mornings with the duchess. The countess
was kind to Elizabeth, but she was a rare admirer of
etiquette. When she was with the duchess, she actually<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_56">[56]</span>
wished to see all her letters, which was naturally annoying
to a married woman; she also expected them to be
couched in the most formal manner, as addressed <em>to a
ducal person</em>! Hence, when Elizabeth was away from
the duchess, and Lady Oxford was with her, the letters
were often written under cover to the duchess’s two
lady dressers, so as to indulge in fewer formalities;
also, as can be read in <cite>Mrs. Delany’s Memoirs</cite> in letters
from the duchess, nicknames were often set up between
the circle of friends, known only to themselves in case
of their being opened. This passage in the letter will
point to the formality of the circle when including Lady
Oxford—</p>

in a great store of Italian, which I cannot read with the

<p>The lady to be married was Anne Granville, whose
nickname was “Pip”; she was about to be married to
Mr. John D’Ewes. “Pen” was Mrs. Pendarves’ nickname,
afterwards Mrs. Delany, and those who have read
her memoirs will remember how unhappy was her <em>first</em>
experience of married life. Much mention is made in
this letter of an apron Elizabeth is working for the
duchess; she begs for patterns of flowers from her
father’s pencil, and Mr. Hateley, an artist friend. Embroidered
aprons were then the rage, but only for demi-toilette;
the beautiful Duchess of Queensberry,<a id="1_FNanchor_127" href="#1_Footnote_127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 127">[127]</a> going
to Court in an apron about this time, was forbidden
to attend. The aprons were of all colours as well as
white, and the duchess, fearing a light ground would
soon soil, bade Elizabeth work hers on a black ground.
Sarah Robinson at the same time was working her
sister one.</p>

Charlemagne makes his procession round the town,
which is an annual ceremony, and the most solemn
and ridiculous I have seen. He built the town, and
made it an imperial city, and this procession is in
memory of him. He is represented by a pasteboard
figure, 12 feet high (for they will have him a giant),
he has on his head a very fine curled and powdered
full-bottomed periwig, an Imperial crown on that; downwards,
he has a yellow damask night-gown, which hides
those who carry him. He walks round the city attended
by all the Orders in their different habits (which is a
pretty sight),—the magistracy, and the Host carried
under a canopy. They stopped before the Town House
where we were, and said Mass at an altar raised on
purpose, then they adored the Host, and Charlemagne
stooped and goggled his eyes, which are pulled by
wires, and so the ceremony ended. We landed at Deal

<div class="sidenote">THE REV. DR. YOUNG</div>

<p>On September 23, in a letter of Elizabeth to her
sister, we first hear of Dr. Young, the author of “<cite>Night
Thoughts</cite>.” At this time this celebrated poem was not
written, but various other poems, satires, and tragedies
had made him famous. Edward Young, LL.D., was
born in 1684, educated at Winchester, New College,
and Corpus Christi, Oxford; in 1730 was Rector of
Welwyn, Herts; in 1731 he married Lady Betty Lee,<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_60">[60]</span>
widow of Colonel Lee, and daughter of the Earl of Lichfield.
The Duke of Wharton was his literary patron.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Young is coming soon. We wish for his
coming, for I hear he is agreeable, and, indeed, his
private character is excellent. He sends his compliments
to me when he writes to the Duchess, and says
he is perfectly acquainted with me, and all that is the
vision of a Poet, for I never saw him in my life, but he
is so kind as to commend me and all my works in all
places.”</p>

is with us. I am much entertained with him, he is a
very sensible man, has a lively imagination, and strikes
out very pretty things in his conversation, tho’ he has
satyrized the worst of our sex, he honours the best of
them extremely, and seems delighted with those who
act and think reasonably. I think he has written a
Satire against that composition of oddity, affectation,
and folly which is called ‘a pretty sort of a woman,’—if
anyone has a mind to put on that character they
need only pervert their sense, distort their faces, disjoint
their limbs, mince their phrases, and lisp their
words, and the thing is done, grimaces, trite sentences,
affected civility, forced gaiety, and an imitation of good
nature completes the character.... That sentences,
systems and definitions should give way to Cribbage,

the fine cloaths that were made for the Birthday. Lady

Duchess of Queensberry<a id="1_FNanchor_138" href="#1_Footnote_138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 138">[138]</a> was such as should be shown
at Courts and feasts, and high solemnities, where most
may wonder at the workmanship; her cloaths were
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_64">[64]</span>embroidered upon white satin; Vine leaves, Convolvulus
and Rosebuds shaded after Nature; but she in herself
was so far beyond the masterpiece of art, that one
could hardly look at her cloaths; allowing for her age I
never saw so beautiful a creature. Miss Pitt<a id="1_FNanchor_139" href="#1_Footnote_139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 139">[139]</a> had a

fancy.’ I did not see any new fashions, as to the wearing
stays, I think they are as usual. I do not know
what will become of your fine shape, for there is a
fashionable make that is very strange. I believe they
look in London as they did in Rome after the Rape of
the Sabines.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sister</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I have been walking in the Park this morning,
and returned only time enough to dress, so while Deb
is tiffing and tiffing till my hair is so pure and so crisp,
I am writing a line to you to the great vexation of Mrs.
Mincing, who is afraid I should be the worst dressed
for it. I don’t wonder an ‘Abigail’ that is kept only as
a Minister of the toilette should look upon dressing as
the great concern of life, but that other people should
make such a point of it I marvel greatly. Some women
by endeavouring to be as handsome as they can are not
so charming as they might be. I never thought a head
agreeably dressed that had not a hair awry; such
punctuality may become a tyre woman, but cannot
a belle, but however, it becomes everybody to be
dressed for dinner, which will not be the case if I
do not conclude. I am to go to the ‘Penseroso and
Allegro’ to-night. The music of the ‘Penseroso’ some
say is best, ‘but Mirth with thee I choose to live.’
Adieu.”</p>

<p>One can, indeed, pity the unfortunate Abigail with
“Fidget” writing whilst she had her hair dressed!
Once after a visit to Bullstrode, the duchess says she
had found a glass-stand left behind by Elizabeth, should
she send it? And the reply was that the stand was
used for her to rest her chin on whilst her maid dressed
her hair. The ridiculously high coiffure of the day

my Mamma; and if the dire Hyp does haunt a solitary
chimney corner, sure it will visit my Pappa now it is
sure to find him at home and alone. For my part, I am
in the case of poor David, my friends and kinsfolk stand
afar off; and when I am to return home I don’t know.
That the distemper may not continue, my Pappa has
sent away half a dozen servants who have not had it,
and says he hopes to have me back again very soon;
but indeed I hope to prevail upon him to try how the
air of Mount Morris agrees with his servants, before I
return. I live here very easy, and I have got books and
all the necessaries and comforts, though not the pomps
and pleasures of life. The family are civil and sensible
people. As for the Master of the house, he is indeed,
to a tittle, Spenser’s meagre personage called Care: his
chief accomplishment as to behaviour is silence. I never
see him but at dinner and supper, and then he eats his
pudding and holds his tongue. I believe his learning
amounts to knowing that four pennies make a groat, and
the sooner that groat is a sixpence he thinks the better.
To give your grace a notion of the sort of persons who
compose the Drama:—They are above Farmers considerably,
have been possessed in the family, for aught I
know, since the Conqueror of above £400 a year, they
have a good old house, neatly furnished, but there is
nothing of modern structure to be seen in it.</p>

<p>“I am now sitting in an old crimson velvet elbow
chair, I should imagine to be elder brother to that which
is shown in Westminster Abbey as Edward the Confessor’s.
There are long tables in the room that have
more feet than the caterpillar you immured at Bullstrode.
Why so many legs are needful to stand <em>still</em>, I cannot
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_68">[68]</span>imagine, when I can fidget on two. There is a good
chest of drawers in the figure of a Cathedral, and a
looking glass which Rosamond or Jane Shore may have
dressed their heads in. Not to forget the clock, who
has indeed been a time server; it has struck the blessed
minutes of the Reformation, Restoration, Abdication,
Revolution, and Accession, and by its relation to time
seems to have some to Eternity. It is like its old
Master, only good to point the hour to industry; ...
it calls his servant to yoke the oxen, get ready the
plough, wakes the dairy maid to milk and churn, the
daughters hear in it the paternal voice chiding the waste
of hours, and rise obedient to its early call; even me it
governs, sends me to bed at ten, and makes me rise, oh
barbarous! at eight.... The mother of the family, a
venerable matron of grave deportment, who was well
educated, and moves in the form of antique ceremonies,
but is really a sensible woman! The daughters are
good housewifes, and I like some qualities in them,
which I understand better than their economy. I only
wish they could sleep in their beds in the morning, and
wake in a chair in the evening!” ...</p>

A COUNTRY SQUIRE</div>

<p>The next letter to Mrs. Donnellan, whom Elizabeth rebukes
for her silence, is dated April 10. In this she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Before this time you must have been informed by
the Duchess or Mrs. Pendarves of my distress, and also
my flight from the maternal mansion to the house in the
neighbourhood. I am at present very happy as my
sister is out of all danger, and I rejoice in thinking she
will have one enemy of life and health the less. So
much for the state of my mind; the situation of my
person is not so gay and cheerful. My best friends
among the living are a Colony of rooks who have settled
themselves in a grove by my window. They wake me
early in the morning.... I have not yet discovered the
form of their government, but I imagine it is democratical....
If I continue here long I shall grow a good
naturalist. I have applied myself to nursing chickens,
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_69">[69]</span>and have been forming the manners of a young calf, but
I find it a very dull scholar. I intend to gather some
cowslips for Mrs. Perceval<a id="1_FNanchor_145" href="#1_Footnote_145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 145">[145]</a> as soon as they appear;
pray let me know if they should be prepared in any
particular manner....</p>

<p>“There are some squires here who would make
excellent Polyphemus’s; one of them drank tea here
yesterday, and complimented me with all the force of
rural gallantry, but for some fault in the flattery or the
flatterer, I liked neither him nor myself any better for
all the fine things he said. After he was gone I did but
relieve my spleen with some laughter on the subject,
when I was told by the matron of the family, he would
be a good match for a woman with twenty thousand
pounds, and indeed could one lend out one’s liking upon
land security, I think one might very well settle it upon
him. To laugh at a poor man is barbarous. He is a
great friend of the family I am with, and I fear will
come often; and in spite of his respectable manors and
fee simple, and ancient mansion, both great and good,
I shall not be able to give a serious attention to his
discourse.</p>

<p>“I wish you could see my habitation, a right reverend
and venerable one it is; the staircase that leads to my
chamber is hung with the funeral escutcheons of my
grandfathers, grandmothers, Aunts and Uncles, that I
seem to be entering the burying vault of the family to
sleep with my Fathers. It is a comfort, no doubt, to
think one’s ancestors have had Christian burial, but
of what use are these tawdry escutcheons? Sure no
passion of the mind, no situation of the human creature
is without vanity, if the mourner can adorn with pomp,
and the breathless carcase be dressed in it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan again writes on April 15—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I like your situation extremely, but I should wish
you one rational companion, for I do not think you
were made for calves or poultry, or greater brutes in
the shape of country squires. What is come of Pan?
He used to find out a pretty female in her retirement,
but as he has been sometimes a little dangerous, I think
I had rather recommend you to the conversation of the
wood nymphs. I have often wished to be acquainted
with them, I fancy they are very innocent, and free from
vanity and affectation, a little ignorant, and indeed in
the fashions and amusements of London, as dress,
cards, old china, Japan, shells, etc., but they may have
notions of friendship and honour, and such antiquated

<p>“I have read no further than Cicero’s<a id="1_FNanchor_147" href="#1_Footnote_147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 147">[147]</a> consulship.
By what I have read of Atticus in other authors
particularly the Abbé St. Real,<a id="1_FNanchor_148" href="#1_Footnote_148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 148">[148]</a> who has given his
character, and translated <cite>Cicero’s letters</cite> to him, I had
not so high an opinion of him as I find Doctor Middleton
has given you. I met yesterday, at Pen’s, the Bishop<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_71">[71]</span>
of Oxford,<a id="1_FNanchor_149" href="#1_Footnote_149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 149">[149]</a> Mrs. Secker and Miss Talbot,<a id="1_FNanchor_150" href="#1_Footnote_150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 150">[150]</a> and they
seemed to think Dr. Middleton was not so much the
historian as the Panegyrist of Cicero, indeed one
observation I have already made myself, I think him
too like a modern Lawyer who pleads all causes good or
bad that gets him interest which was money to them;
but when I have read the whole I will read St. Real
again, and then I will tell you more of my mind. I long
till you read Horace, and think he would be particularly
proper in your present retirement, he seems to know
how to amuse himself in such a scene better than any
one I ever met with, at the same time that he was the
delight of the politest court<a id="1_FNanchor_151" href="#1_Footnote_151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 151">[151]</a> that ever was. I really
think you have much of the genius of distinguishing
right from wrong, and not being led away by the false
glosses of the world, and want to know whether you
find that conformity.</p>

<p>“I told you in my last I wished to spend some time
with you in your banishment. I am so sincere in it,
that if you were in a place where they are not above
being paid for my lodging and board, I would come to
you for one fortnight before you go home....</p>

<p>“My Mother desires her compliments to you, and

made me very happy. If my friends at a distance did
not keep my affections awake, I should be lulled into a
state of insensibility, divided as I am from all I love....
What’s Cicero to me or I to Cicero? as Hamlet would
say; and for myself, though this same little, insignificant
self be very dear unto me, yet I have not used to make
it my sole object of love and delight....</p>

<p>“I want just such a companion as you would be, and
how happy would your kind compliance with that wish
make me, if the good old folk here would accommodate
you; but they are so fearful of strangers, I know it
impossible to persuade them to it. They are not very
fine people; they have a little estate, and help it out
with a little farming: are very busy and careful, and the
old man’s cautionness has dwindled into penuriousness,
so that he eats in fear of waste and riot, sleeps with the
dread of thieves, denies himself everything for fear of
wanting anything, riches give him no plenty, increase
no joy, prosperity no ease: he has the curse of covetousness
to want the property of his neighbours, while he
dare not touch his own: the Harpy Avarice drives him
from his own meat, the sum of his wisdom and his gains
will be by living poor, to die rich....</p>

<p>The letter concludes with a long postscript; the
duke had put the letter into his pocket to give the
porter himself, not wishing, he says, to trust “Mr. Puff”
with it, and forgot it for some days. Despite of all
letters being sealed, they were constantly tampered
with, adroit incisions under the seals could be made,

<div class="sidenote">MATTHEW ROBINSON —<br>
A BROTHER’S ADMIRATION</div>

<p>On April 27 occurs a most brotherly letter from
Matthew from Bath. It is too long to place here in full,<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_78">[78]</span>
but so beautiful are his words to his sister, showing
his love and admiration for her, that I give a few
extracts. He had just received a letter of her’s which
pleased him, and says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I should be ashamed after so long a friendship with
you to be ignorant of any of your talents, yet I do
assure you there are some of them that after so long an
accquaintance with them, I have not yet done admiring.
It is never without great delight that I see in one whom
I esteem so much, that tho’ in company one would swear
your parts and spirits were contrived purposely for
laughter, and the chearful round of mirth, yet study and
thought, contemplation of the ways of men, or works of
Nature, and consequently enjoyment of yourself, and
ease and happiness, the end of all good, never desert
your leisure and retirement. You never had greater
reason for this turn of mind, or better trial of your
temper on that account than lately, when driven from
your friends, and almost alone, in a manner you never
were before, and probably may never be again: you
were fairly left to the food and entertainment of your
own thoughts; and though it would be impertinent
now to mention my general opinion of your letters, I
don’t remember that I ever saw your thoughts stamped
upon a piece of paper with greater force of discernment
than in the letter I received from you to-day.... Bating
the tribe of your lovers, you cannot have a more hearty
friend to your person, or more assured admirer of your
merit and accomplishments.”</p>
</div>

<p>Surely few brothers have ever paid a more graceful
tribute of praise to a sister! Matthew was born in 1713,
and was consequently seven years older than Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SMALLPOX</div>

<p>On May 9, in a letter to Mr. Freind, we learn the two
sisters had met again—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had the joy of seeing my dear Pea yesterday; I
cannot express the happiness of such a meeting, but it is<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_79">[79]</span>
saying enough to own it more than recompensed the
pangs of parting. It is truly, as well as poetically said,
‘The heart can ne’er a transport know, that never felt a
pain.’ My desire to be cheered again by that beloved
voice made me desirous of a meeting much sooner than
I should be otherwise, in my shameful fear of the distemper,
have desired. We talked about an hour in the
open air, at about two yards’ distance: she kept her hat
so close I could not see her face, but as soon as it has
nothing left of the distemper, but the redness, I am to
see her. I am now within sight of our house at a farm
just at the bottom of the gates. I have a very good room,
warm and comfortable. It is so low that it flatters my
pride by indulging me with an approach to the ceiling.
My Mamma had sent furniture for the room from Mount
Morris, as soon as my sister was growing better, that I
might come so near as to be accustomed to the family,
and so return to it at leisure without any apprehensions.”</p>
</div>

<p>Reproaching Mr. Freind for silence in this letter, he
writes, May 19, in return to plead his parochial duties,
and amusingly says in defence—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am forced in the country, every week to make
a sermon, at home or abroad, however engaged, made it

Stomachs, which, if they can digest, ’tis often more than I
myself can do.... An express arrived last night from
Admiral Vernon; Carthagena was not actually taken,
but the captain who brings the news imagines it might
be taken in about 12 hours after he left it. All the
Spanish ships and galleons that were in the Harbour
were burnt, most of the fortifications battered down,
enough to discover there was great confusion in the
town. Not a ship of ours was hurt when he departed.
But there is always a black flag attends in the train of
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_80">[80]</span>Victory; the general joy overcomes indeed all private
concern; but those who have friends or relations in the

presently, Col. Douglas of the Marines had his head shot
off, Lieutenant Sandford of Wentworth’s Regiment was
shot in his tent before the town, Col. Watson of the
Artillery was killed by a shot in the thigh, Capt. Moor
was killed, Lieutenant Turvin had just taken the Colours
from his dead ensign, and was killed with them in his
hand (‘There’s honour for you,’ says Sir J. Falstaffe),

A SOUTH SEA LAWSUIT</div>

<p>Alas! in this he was premature, his brother-in-law,

the attack on St. Lazare, near Carthagena. May 12, Mrs.
Donnellan writes from London—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are squabbling about Elections, and proving
right wrong, and wrong right, just as we think it will
make for some little private interest, without the least
regard to truth, justice, or any notion of the good of
the country. The Westminster Election was finished
in a most partial manner on Friday, in favour of the
Court candidates, and Lord Sundon<a id="1_FNanchor_162" href="#1_Footnote_162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 162">[162]</a> was like to be
torn to pieces by the mob in revenge: this has been
the subject of much talk, and last night I happened to
say to a clergyman (who I thought by his gown was
obliged to join with me), that I thought the dishonesty
that prevailed in Elections was terrible, and corrupted
the private honesty in all ranks of people, when my
Parson to my surprise took up the argument that
bribery in a King and his Ministers was not dishonest,
but politic, and that we could not subsist without it, and
ran on to prove that we must conform to the times, and
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_81">[81]</span>if my neighbour bribes, I must do so too, to be on a

<p>At this period Elizabeth developed a most painful
weakness of the eyes, which recurred at intervals during
the rest of her life. She attributed it to reading so much
at night during her absence from home while her sister
was ill. The duchess writes to implore her not to work,
or read, and she answers, “I follow your grace’s advice,
I do not work at all, and I read by my sister’s eyes.”
She had commenced dining at Mount Morris, but they
would not let her go upstairs for fear of infection, so
she still slept at the farm. Mr. Freind had in his last
letter said, “Let us know all about you; when you set
sail, <i>i.e.</i> when you are to be manned, and who is to be
your Captain, for these things surely must be settled
now.” To which she answers—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am not going to set sail yet; the ocean of fortune
is rough, the bark of fortune light, the prosperous gale
uncertain, but the Pilot must be smooth, steady and
content, patient in storms, moderate and careful in sunshine,
and easy in the turns of the wind, and changes of
the times. Guess if these things be easily found? and
without such a guide can I avoid the gulph of misfortune,
the barking of envy, the deceits of the syrens, and the
hypocrisy of Proteus? So I wait on the shore, scarce
looking towards this land of promise, so few I find with
whom I would risk the voyage. I would have wrote you
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_82">[82]</span>a longer letter, if I had a frank, but careful of your
sixpence, though regardless of your leisure, that consideration
hinders me. I am at Mount Morris again.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">“LIFE OF CICERO”</div>

<p>The duchess having commenced reading <cite>Dr. Conyers
Middleton’s “Life of Cicero,”</cite> Elizabeth recommends a
pamphlet called <cite>“Observations on Cicero,” written by
Mr. Lyttelton</cite>,<a id="1_FNanchor_165" href="#1_Footnote_165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 165">[165]</a> but without his name being prefixed to
it. She states, “Dr. Middleton compliments it in his
preface slightly; it is as much a criticism as the Doctor’s
is a panegyric of Tully’s action: it is a very little book,
but I think wrote with great spirit and elegance.”</p>

<p class="para1">“You will be much surprised to receive so
melancholy a letter from me after that strange medley
you had last post, but yesterday morning I was told the
Doctor had no hopes of my Papa; he hurt his leg some
time ago, and Sergeant Dickens has had it in hand, and
declared to Dr. Mead<a id="1_FNanchor_166" href="#1_Footnote_166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 166">[166]</a> he would go on no longer without
another surgeon was called in, upon which Skipton
was sent for, and what will be the result of their consultations
to-day I dread to know; he has besides a
jaundice and dropsy. He was out Friday night, and
pretty well of Saturday night, and grew so much worse
yesterday morning that he is not able to move. The
Doctor was surprised to find such an alteration in a few
hours. Oh! my dear Fidget, ’tis not possible to flatter
oneself, God only knows what is best for us, therefore
I am sensible I ought to be contented with what He is
pleased to inflict upon us, but I cannot help my natural
weakness. I can’t see to add any more, my heart and
eyes are too full.”</p>

show the least regret at leaving this troublesome world,

moving a scene for me even to tell now.” ...</p>
</div>

<p>At the end she begs Elizabeth not to write to her, as
her eyes were so bad, but to get Sarah to do so instead,
and in all her trouble remembers to send two bottles
of arquebusade to Matthew Robinson’s chambers which
he wanted, the price being 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a bottle.</p>

<p>Edward, 2nd Earl of Oxford, was the son of Robert,
1st Earl, by his first marriage with Elizabeth Foley,
sister of Thomas, 1st Lord Foley; he continued to
collect the Harleian <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>,<a id="1_FNanchor_168" href="#1_Footnote_168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 168">[168]</a> begun by his father, now in

</div>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth wrote to condole heartily with the duchess
on her sad loss, but imploring her, for the sake of the
duke and her dear little children, to endeavour to bear
up under this sad blow, for father and daughter were
tenderly attached to each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ONE-HORSE CHAISE</div>

<p>The universal panacea of bleeding—for one can only
judge by the manner in which doctors applied to it for<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_84">[84]</span>
every case—had been endured by Elizabeth for the sake
of her eyes, and she says “my eyes are worse for the
bleeding.” She had a narrow escape at this time: her
brother Matthew driving her for her health along the
seashore on a high bank raised to keep off the incursion
of the sea, the horse bolted, but fortunately their servant
outrider was able to stop it without its bolting down
either side of the bank. It is characteristic of the times
that she calls a one-horse chaise, “of all things the most
ridiculous!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan had been ill, and was ordered to
Tunbridge Wells, to drink the waters. There was hope
of Dr. Young being there. “I believe you will find his
thoughts little confined to the place; he will entertain
you with conversation much above what one generally
finds there, where they talk of little but water, bread,
butter, and scandal.”</p>

<p>On July 5 the duchess writes to say they had
carried their cause in the law suit. She also expresses
her joy at hearing Matthew Robinson intended to be
inoculated that autumn. Elizabeth said if her eyes and
general health were better, she would be inoculated too.
She had just been given, “by a wise son of Æsculapius,
a diabolical bolus that half killed me. I fainted away
about three hours after I swallowed the notable composition,
and was above an hour in such agony that if
I had not waited for your letter I had certainly gone to
the Elysian fields.”</p>

<p>A letter of Mrs. Botham’s from Elford, of which
place, as well as of Yoxall, Staffordshire, her husband
was Vicar, mentions a legacy left to her and her sister,
Mrs. Laurence Sterne—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My husband is in the North; his journey thither
happened very opportunely, for an ancient woman
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_85">[85]</span>whose very name I am a stranger to, has lately dyed
intestate, and my Sister and self are heirs at law of her
real estate, which consists of some houses at Leeds, the

which is upwards of £5000, but that I have no hopes of.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WINDSOR HATTER</div>

has returned from Tunbridge Wells after a six weeks’
visit; staying with her married sister, Mrs. Clayton, and
her husband, Robert Clayton, Bishop of Killala, and
afterwards of Clogher. The bishop very nobly gave
his wife’s paternal fortune to her sister, Anne Donnellan.
Dr. Young was at Tunbridge, and Mrs. Donnellan
states—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I conversed much with Doctor Young, but I had not

Hall, Kent, was a friend of the Robinsons. She had a
large family, seven sons and seven daughters; one was
lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Orange, and married
a Monsieur Saumaize, a member of the suite. Her sister
Caroline, or “Cally Scott” (her pet-name), was the
bosom friend of Sarah Robinson, and eventually married
a Mr. Best. Another, Cecilia, who died unmarried, was
a friend to the Robinson family for life. To Mrs.
Donnellan Elizabeth writes on September 13, and in a
long letter she says—</p>

<p>“The time for my brother’s inoculation draws near,
and though I have a very good opinion of that method
of having the smallpox, yet I cannot enjoy a perfect
tranquillity of mind till it is over. I would fain persuade
him to have it done while I am in the country, but he
will not grant my request; for my Pappa, I believe, will
not let me go to Bullstrode at all, if I don’t go before
that is over; and my brother therefore waits for my
departure, that I may not be banished for six weeks or
two months, which he imagines would be melancholy
for me these long evenings, as I should have no friend
with me, and am not able to divert myself with books
now my eyes are bad.”</p>
</div>

<p>The duchess was waiting for Lady Oxford’s departure
from Bullstrode. Lady Oxford is often alluded to
as “the Speaker” by the duchess, the same name, as
has been mentioned, was bestowed on Mrs. Robinson
by her children. Elizabeth’s health being so indifferent,
her parents wished her to consult Dr. Mead, and early
in October she proceeded to London with her brother
Tom, where she stayed a few days with Mrs. Donnellan<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_87">[87]</span>
in Bond Street, and on October 13 joined her beloved
friends at Bullstrode, the duchess sending her coach to
London to fetch her.</p>

<p>Matthew was to be inoculated as soon as the coach
returned to Mount Morris from taking Elizabeth to
town, as, till the smallpox appeared, he was to take the
air daily in it; but the inoculation did not take, and
Elizabeth’s tender fears for her brother were allayed.</p>

<p>“I return you many thanks for your directions for

generous contempt of money in a point in which there
are other things superior to it; he bears an excellent
character, there is much prudence in knowing how to
separate one’s particular happiness from that which is
reckoned so in the world’s opinion: if Lord Sandwich
takes greater pleasure in the conversation of a fine
woman than in viewing a collection of medals and
pictures, he is right to prefer Miss Dolly Fane with
£5000 to Miss Spinckes with £50,000.... He has a good
estate sufficient for the becoming state of a nobleman....
Miss Fane is a happy woman to have a lover so great,
so generous, and so good. Love has a good right over
the marriages of men, but not of women; for men raise
their wives to their ranks, women stoop to their
husbands, if they choose below themselves. I think all
our neighbours are in a marrying humour. I wish

should have had now a gallant young neighbourhood.”</p>

Writing to Sarah, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am better than I was, but my mouth not being
yet perfectly reduced, I have got a fresh blister upon
my back, well may it bend with such a weight of
calamities.... I have sent for my bathing Cloaths, and
on Sunday night shall take a souze. I think it a pleasant
remedy. I am to sit a quarter of an hour in the bath,
and then go to bed and lye warm; it is to be repeated
three times a week.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">DUCAL BATHS!</div>

<p>The next letter to her mother throws a curious light
on the personal cleanliness of the day, and the want of
baths in a ducal house—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“November 6, 1741.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I should write to you much oftener, if I was
able, but really I am so taken up with the pursuit of
health I have little time for other employments. My
lip is not entirely reduced, though I have been blistered
twice, once blooded, and have five times taken physick,
have lived upon chicken and white meats, and drank
nothing but water; however, I am now vastly better
than I was, and have hardly any pimples in my face,
and no complaint in my eyes or nose, only this abominable
lip is still rather bigger than it used to be. I
intend to keep the blister going till it is well, for Mr.
Clarke has put me in a way of doing it, so that I do not
suffer much. I have suffered great disappointment
about the warm bath, which I am advised to try, for the
bathing tubs are so out of order we have not yet been
able to make them hold water, but I hope next week
they will serve the purpose.” ...</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_89">[89]</span></p>
<p>At the end of the letter is this: “Mary brings me
word my bathing tub<a id="1_FNanchor_173" href="#1_Footnote_173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 173">[173]</a> is ready for use; so to-morrow
I shall go in. Pray look for my bathing dress, till then
I must go in in chemise and jupon!” Evidently from
this it was not considered proper to go into a bath,
even in a bedroom, <i>au naturel</i>!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW LADY’S-MAID —<br>
A MICROSCOPE</div>

<p>Another light on domestic service of the day is given
in the next letter to Sarah. For some reason Elizabeth
had a new lady’s-maid, and it appears from this and
other letters that a superior class of persons officiated
in that capacity. Many a clergyman’s daughter was
glad to be lady’s-maid or housekeeper in those days—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p id="1_dufour">“I like my maid extreamly; she is very humble,
sensible, quick and diligent, and though her Father
and Mother are above the common rate, she has never
presumed to hint she was a person of fashion, which
the French generally brag of. Mrs. Hog<a id="1_FNanchor_174" href="#1_Footnote_174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 174">[174]</a> (ye ladies’
French woman), tells me Mr. Dufour was a scarlet Dyer,
worth once five or six thousand pounds, and Mrs.
Dufour had about £1600 for her fortune, but by the
knavery of a partner in their trade, they were reduced.
I think Mary works pretty quick, and washes well, and
is very handy, and she talks much better French than
Dulac.</p>

<p>“I am reading <cite>Dr. Swift’s and Mr. Pope’s letters</cite>. I like
them much, and find great marks of friendship, goodness
and affection between these people whom the world is
apt to think too wise to be honest, and too witty to be
affectionate, but vice is the child of folly, rather than
of wisdom; and for insensibility of heart, like that of
the head, it belongeth unto fools. Lord Bolingbroke’s
letters shine much in the collection. We are reading<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_90">[90]</span>

the answer to the Roman Catholic is full, and I doubt
not the Protestant will be as happily silenced. Truth
will maintain its ground against all opposition.</p>

<p>“We expect Mr.<a id="1_FNanchor_177" href="#1_Footnote_177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 177">[177]</a> and Mrs. West, and then we shall

for the first there is nothing of speculation, either in the
Terra Firma of Reason, or the Visionary province of
fancy, into which he does not lead the imagination. In
his conversation he examines everything, determines
hardly anything, but leaves one’s judgment at liberty.
The other goes far into a subject, and seldom leaves the
conclusion of an argument unfinished; he seems to me
to have a very accurate judgment, and a very attentive
observation of everything that comes within his view,

<p>Thomas Robinson, the second brother, had this year
brought out his celebrated legal book, entitled “Common
Law of Kent, or the Customs of Gavel Kind, with
an appendix concerning Borough English,” to this day
a well-referred-to book. In 1822 a third edition was
published, and another in 1858, revised by J. D.
Norwood. Thomas was of Lincoln’s Inn, was admitted
April 14, 1730. The “<cite>National Biography</cite>” states he
was never called to the Bar, which must be a mistake,
as there is frequent mention of his pleading cases at
Canterbury and elsewhere in the manuscripts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEW YEAR’S DAY</div>

<p>This year opens with a letter to Mrs. Donnellan, a
portion of which I copy—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Bullstrode, January 1, 1742.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Donnellan</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“Though there is no day of the year in which
one does not wish all happiness to one’s friends, this is
the particular day in which the heart goes forth in
particular vows and wishes for the welfare of those it
loves. It is the birth of a new year, whose entrance we
would salute, and hope auspicious; nor is this particular
mark of time of little use: it teaches us to number our
days, which a wise man thought an incitement to the
well spending them; and, indeed, did we consider how
much the pleasure and profit of our lives depends upon
an economy of our time, we should not waste it as we
do, in idle repentance, or reflection on the past, or a vain
unuseful regard for the future. In youth we defer being
prudent till we are old, and look forward to a promise
of wisdom as the portion of latter years: when we are
old we seek not to improve, and scarce employ ourselves;
looking backward to our youth as to the day of
our diligence, and take a pride in laziness, saying we
rest as after the accomplishment of our undertakings;
but we ought to ask for our daily merit, as for our
daily bread. The mind, no more than the body, can be
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_98">[98]</span>sustained by the food taken yesterday, or promised for
to-morrow. Every day ought to be considered as a
period apart, some virtue should be exercised, some
knowledge improved, and the value of happiness well
understood, some pleasure comprehended in it; some
duty to ourselves or others must be infringed if any of
these things are neglected....</p>

<p>“I beg of you to reserve Monday morning for me, and
I will spend it all with you; on Tuesday I set out for
Mount Morris, and on Sunday night Pen<a id="1_FNanchor_198" href="#1_Footnote_198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 198">[198]</a> desires you
to be at her house. I hope to return to you in the
beginning of March for between two and three months.
Our happy society is just breaking up, but I will think
of it with gratitude, and not with regret, and thank Fate
for the joyful hours she lent me....</p>

<p>“This year does not promise me much pleasure as the
last has afforded me here, but the fairest gifts of fate
come often unexpected.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD GEORGE BENTINCK</div>

<p>This sentence was, had she known it, prophetic, for
this very year was to furnish her with an excellent and
loving husband, a position of importance, and a plentiful
fortune. In a letter to Sarah at this period mention is
made by Elizabeth of Lord George Bentinck (the duke’s
uncle) having been ill, and the means taken for his
recovery!—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lord George is much better than he was, and
Drs. Mead and Sandys have not determined whether
it <em>is</em> gout. I hope it is not; he has been <em>blooded forty
ounces</em> within this week, and they say looks as florid
as ever!”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">NORTHFLEET FAIR</div>

<p>Elizabeth now left the duchess, joining her sister,
who was in town with her friend, Mrs. Cotes, and writes
to her beloved duchess from Sittingbourne, their halting-place
<i>en route</i> home. In this letter she says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_99">[99]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I arrived at Northfleet, where we dined,
every Phillis and Corydon were at a fair in the town,
and to enter into the humours of the place, I walked
through it. In one booth were nymphs and swains
buying garters, with amorous posies, some only with
the humble request, ‘When these you see, remember
me’; others with a poetical and more familiar ‘Be true
to me, as I’m to thee.’ Under another booth, for the
pleasure of bold British youths, was Admiral Vernon in
gingerbread; indeed he appeared in many shapes there,
and the curate of the parish carried him home in a brass
tobacco stopper. I was a little concerned to see him
lying in passive gingerbread, upon a stall with Spanish
nuts; but the politicians of our age are wonderful in
reconciling the interest of nations. I assure you there
was a great deal of company; many hearts did I see
exchanged for fairings of cherry-coloured ribbon; and
one Cymon more polished than the rest, presented his
damsel with a fan, with the intent, I presume, not to
give ‘coolness to the matchless Dame.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Of politics and the opposition to Sir Robert Walpole,
we now gain a glimpse in a letter of Mrs. Donnellan’s of
January 14 to Elizabeth—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is certainly believed that the King has sent an
offer of a reconciliation, and that tempter gold, to the
Prince<a id="1_FNanchor_199" href="#1_Footnote_199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 199">[199]</a> by the Bishop of Oxford,<a id="1_FNanchor_200" href="#1_Footnote_200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 200">[200]</a> whose answer was
that while Sir Robert, who he apprehended had raised
his Majesty’s resentment against him, was at Court, he
could not appear there, but that if he was removed, he
would fly without any other conditions but to have the
happiness of throwing himself at his Majesty’s feet.”</p>

<p>On February 4 the duchess writes in bad spirits to
“Fidget”; the duke was ill with the gout, and her little
girl, Lady Fanny, had had a convulsion fit, for which
“she was blistered and blooded within 12 hours:”
drastic treatment for an unfortunate infant not a year
old! In this letter we read—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The King sent Sir Robert word that he had no
more orders for him, and that he must resign, but that
he made him Earl of Orford. Others report that upon
his losing the election of Bainton, Rolt, and Sir Edmund
Thomas, he went to the King and told him the current
ran so strongly against him he could no longer be of
service to him, but that he would come into the House
of Lords. Lord Wilmington<a id="1_FNanchor_202" href="#1_Footnote_202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 202">[202]</a> is to act as first Lord of

<p>On February 9 Mrs. Pendarves writes the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Clarges Street, February 9, 1742.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Robinson will think me very dilatory
in obeying her commands, but the uneasy situation I
have been in, surrounded by sick friends<a id="1_FNanchor_205" href="#1_Footnote_205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 205">[205]</a> and servants,

this time given you some entertainment.</p>

<p>“As for the fringe it should have been sent to you
sooner, could I have found it, but it was buried under
such a variety of rubbish it was like digging in a mine
to find it. Don’t let these delays discourage you from
making use of me again, for no one can take more
pleasure in being your humble servant than I do. This
is asserting a bold truth, and would draw on me numbers
of challenges, if I published it. I should not be afraid
of accepting the combat where my cause was so good.
Our letters crost on the road. Your observation on
retirement is very just, and all your thoughts show the
good use you make of Retirement; but I wish for my
own sake to draw you out of it. I am not so unreasonable
as to expect to hear often from you. I can’t justly
make that demand, but if you were in town I should
endeavour to have a great deal of your company; let me
know when I may hope to see you. At present I can
give you no very inviting reason for coming; as to the
entertainments of the place, all parties are out of humour;
everybody conjectures something; nobody knows anything,
but that Sir R(obert) W(alpole) kissed hands
yesterday as Lord Orford, and his daughter as Lady
Mary, that he resigned yesterday, and goes to Houghton
in a few days. His faithful services to his King are well
rewarded. I have been interrupted by two favourites
of yours, Lord Cornbury and Mrs. Donnellan, and to<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_102">[102]</span>
recommend them still stronger to your favour, they have
prevented your having a dull long letter. I send the
fringe enclosed; if I wait till my spirit is more alert you
may want your apron, and think I have quite neglected
your orders. I will run any hazard rather than give
you just cause to complain of me, and am with great

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I thought it would be agreeable to you to have
an account of the mighty and important proceedings of
both houses yesterday, so I have sent you the question,
which was debated in both Houses with a good deal of
warmth. It was brought into the House of Lords by
Lord Carteret,<a id="1_FNanchor_218" href="#1_Footnote_218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 218">[218]</a> who spoke two hours in opening. Lord
Carlisle and Lord Westmorland spoke with great
warmth, and Lord Carlisle<a id="1_FNanchor_219" href="#1_Footnote_219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 219">[219]</a> was very bitter. Lord
Halifax<a id="1_FNanchor_220" href="#1_Footnote_220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 220">[220]</a> seconded Lord Carteret. Lord Talbot said in
answer to the Duke of Marlborough’s motion (that it
might be voted that an attempt to inflict any kind of
punishment, etc., etc.) that he would not say that all
persons were interested that spoke in favour of Sir
Robert, that they appeared to be so, and upon being
called to order, he said with heat that he was used to
speak truth, and he did believe (by the most sacred
oath) that they were so, and that he was ready to give
any man satisfaction that would require it. All moderate
men voted with the majority in both Houses. Lord
Cornbury and Mr. Harley spoke in favour of Sir R.:
the latter said that though Sir R. had pursued a relation<a id="1_FNanchor_221" href="#1_Footnote_221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 221">[221]</a>
of his without evidence, and caused his imprisonment,
and thereby the shortening of his life, he could not, as
he had differed from him in all his measures, copy him<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_105">[105]</span>
in that, and so withdrew with his brother and many
others who had great disobligations to the Member.
Mr. Skipper would not vote against the great man, for
it seems there was no proof nor evidence of the accusations.
I think the majority was 290 against 190 in the
House of Commons. Many of the Country interest did
not vote at all; they did not break up till three. The
House of Lords at one o’clock in the morning. Mr.
Sandys<a id="1_FNanchor_222" href="#1_Footnote_222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 222">[222]</a> opened very well, and Mr. ‘Ste’-Fox<a id="1_FNanchor_223" href="#1_Footnote_223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 223">[223]</a> spoke on

<div class="sidenote">THE OPERA —<br>
GARRICK</div>

<p>Elizabeth, in a letter to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Freind,
gives us an insight into the Opera of that period—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was at the Opera on Saturday night, where was
all the world. I was very well diverted between the
Opera and the Audience, or I ought rather to say the
Spectators, for they came to see and not to hear. I
heard the Elephant was the finest thing in the Opera,
but that was contradicted, and the burning of the
Temple was preferred to it. To accommodate everything
to the absurdity of the Town, the dancing is
rendered more ridiculous and grotesque than ever.
I was thinking if the Court of Augustus could have seen
the polite part of our nation, admiring a wooden
Elephant, with two lamps stuck for eyes, and poor
Scipio and Asdrubal could have risen to have seen
themselves covered with silver spangles, and quavering
an Italian Air, what an honest indignation and scorn
would they have conceived at us....</p>

<p>“My Sister Pea is abroad; I am confined again by a
little feverishness. I thought as it was a London fever
it might be polite, so I carried it to the Ridotto, Court,
and Opera, but it grew so perverse and stubborn, so I
put it into a White Hood and double handkerchief, and
kept it by the fire these three days, and it is better;
indeed I hope it is worn out. On Saturday I intend to
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_107">[107]</span>go to Goodman’s Fields to see Garrick<a id="1_FNanchor_224" href="#1_Footnote_224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 224">[224]</a> act Richard

have sacrificed enough to folly in catching colds at the

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> made but few allusions to Elizabeth’s love
triumphs, but as the time approaches when she was to
make her final choice, I must now allude to them.
There was a certain “Mr. B.,” from what I can gather
a Mr. Brockman, of Beechborough, a fine place near
Mount Morris, who had been desperately in love with
her for some time; he is frequently alluded to in the
family letters. In one to Sarah at this period Elizabeth
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Poor Mr. B. really takes his misfortunes so to heart
that he is literally dying, indeed I hear he is very ill,
which I am sorry for, but I have no balsam of heartsease
for him, if he should die I will have him buried in
Westminster Abbey next the woman that died of a
prick of a finger, for it is quite as extraordinary, and he
shall have his figure languishing in wax, with ‘Miss
Robinson, fecit,’ wrote over his head; upon my word I
compassionate his pains, and pity him, but as I am as
compassionate, I am as cold too as Charity. He pours
out his soul in lamentations to his friends, and ‘all but
the nymph that should redress his wrong, attend his
passion and approve his song,’ for the Rhyme will
have it so. I am glad he has such a stock of flesh to
waste upon. Waller says that—</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOVERS</div>

<p>A certain captain, name unknown, also inveigled the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Freind to a coffee-house to talk two hours
by the clock of Miss Elizabeth Robinson’s perfections.
About this Elizabeth writes to Mr. Freind—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am very sorry if the poor man is really what you
think, unhappy; if his case is uneasy I am sure it is
desperate; complaint I hope, is more the language, than
misery the condition, of lovers. To speak ingenuously
you men use us oddly enough, you adore the pride,
flatter the vanity, gratify the ill-nature, and obey the
tyranny that insults you; then slight the love, despise
the affection, and enslave the obedience that would
make you happy: when frowning mistresses all are
awful goddesses, when submissive wives, despicable
mortals. There are two excellent lines which have
made me ever deaf to the voice of the charmer, charm’d
he ever so sweetly—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry-etc">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentqq">“‘The humblest Lover when he lowest lies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Submits to conquer, and but kneels to rise.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Flattery has ever been the ladder to power, and I
have detested its inverted effects of worshipping one into
slavery, while it has pretended to adore one to Deification.
If ever I commit my happiness to the hands of
any person, it must be one whose indulgence I can
trust, for flattery I cannot believe. I am sure I have
faults, and am convinced a husband will find them, but
wish he may forgive them; but vanity is apt to seek the
admirer, rather than the friend, not considering that the
passion of love may, but the effect of esteem can never,
degenerate to dislike. I do not mean to exclude Love,
but I mean to guard against the fondness that arises
from personal advantages.... I have known many
men see all the cardinal virtues in a good complexion,
and every ornament of a character in a pair of fine eyes,
and they have married these perfections, which might
perhaps shine and bloom a twelvemonth, and then alas!<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_110">[110]</span>
it appeared these fine characters were only written in
white and red.</p>

<p>“A long and intimate acquaintance is the best presage
of future agreement. I have strengthened this argument
to myself by the example of you and Mrs. Freind.
I hope in my long and tedious dissertation I have said
nothing disrespectful of Love. As for your particular
inducement to it I cannot tell whether it was beauty or
good qualities, they being united in her in a degree of
perfection not to be excelled.”</p>
</div>

<p>After wishing the rejected lover “Riches and alliance
to help his laudable ambition,” she concludes with, “I
wish the same advantages for myself, with one of established
fortune and character, so established, that one
piece of generosity should not hurt his fortune, nor one
act of indiscretion prejudice his character.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR GEORGE LYTTELTON</div>

<p>Who this particular individual was is not now known,
but that Elizabeth was the cynosure of all eyes from
her wit, beauty, and vivacity is shown by her brothers’
letters of this period, which constantly allude to her
troop of admirers. Mr. Lyttelton, now Sir George
Lyttelton, the only single man whom she had ever
mentioned with uniform admiration, married this year,
on June 15, Lucy, daughter of Hugh Fortescue, Esq.,
of Filleigh, Devonshire, a marriage of the purest affection
on both sides.</p>

<p>In a letter at the end of 1741 she states that her
father’s steward in Yorkshire had been guilty of peccadilloes,
and that she was to accompany her parents to
Yorkshire in early spring, where her father promised
her attendance at the York races, in lieu of the Canterbury
ones, which then appeared to her a poor substitute.
Whilst in Yorkshire she either met for the first time,
or more probably renewed her acquaintance with, Mr.
Edward Montagu, her future husband, of whom some
account must now be given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. EDWARD MONTAGU</div>

<p>Edward Montagu was the son of Charles Montagu,
fifth son of the great Earl of Sandwich,<a id="1_FNanchor_226" href="#1_Footnote_226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 226">[226]</a> Lord High
Admiral of the Fleet to Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, and who had acted
as his proxy at his marriage with Catherine of Braganza.
Charles Montagu married twice. By his first wife,
Elizabeth Foster, he had one son, James; he married
for second wife Sarah Rogers, daughter of John Rogers
and his wife, <i>née</i> Margaret Cock. The Rogers owned
large estates at Newcastle-on-Tyne<a id="1_FNanchor_227" href="#1_Footnote_227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 227">[227]</a> and in its neighbourhood.
Charles Montagu, by his second marriage,
had three sons, Edward, Crewe, and John, and a daughter,
Jemima, who was married at the time I am writing of
to Mr. Sydney Medows, afterwards Sir Sydney Medows.
Mr. Edward Montagu was born in 1691, hence he was
twenty-nine years older than Elizabeth. At the time he
courted Elizabeth, another admirer, a young nobleman,
whose name I know not, is stated to have been in love
with her, but constant to her former protestation of
choosing a “formed character” that she could look up to,
she chose the older man. It is odd not a sentence is met
with about him before, except that one of her brothers
chaffs her about “converting a Mr. M—— to dancing,”
which may have referred to him. He was a profound
mathematician, the friend of Emerson and other learned
men of that day. His character was amiable, equable, just,
and of the highest integrity, as is shown by his letters,
and his political conduct as a Member of Parliament in
what was a corrupt age. Mrs. Carter<a id="1_FNanchor_228" href="#1_Footnote_228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 228">[228]</a> mentions him
“as a man of sense, a scholar, and a mathematician” in
her letters. He owned a good estate at Allerthorpe,<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_112">[112]</span>
Yorkshire, and another near Rokeby (the fine estate
belonging to Elizabeth’s cousin, “Long” Sir Thomas
Robinson), also a house in Dover Street, London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. DONNELLAN’S ADVICE —<br>
SWIFT’S YAHOOS</div>

<p>Evidently the letter here inserted in Mrs. Anne
Donnellan’s handwriting, but unsigned, was an answer
to an appeal of Elizabeth’s for advice as to this courtship.
Though long, I consider it so perfectly suitable in its
advice to any persons contemplating matrimony, I give
it <i>in extenso</i>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can’t enough express to you, my dear Friend, how
much your confidence in me obliges me, as it shows me
the place I hold in your heart. The latter part of your
letter, which is what I write to now, is a difficulty I
know how to pity, as I have experienced it, and yet I do
not find I am at all the more capable of advising how to
avoid it; there is a medium between encouragement and
ill humour that is certainly right to avoid being thought
to desire to raise a passion that one does not design to
gratifie, or to be too apt to think one has raised a
passion that must be discouraged, for as I think nothing
is more unjust than to wish to make another unhappy,
merely to gratifie a vanity of being known to be admired,
so nothing is more ridiculous than to be too apt to fancy
one has raised such a passion, and I should always
choose to be the last that perceived it, rather than the
first. I have seen so many appearances of liking that
has proved neither uneasy to one side or t’other, that I
am not apt to fear great hurt from them, and I fancy the
longer you live the more you will be of my mind;
indeed when a man gives way to a passion on a prospect
of success, and finds a disappointment to it, has often, I
believe, given a melancholy turn to his whole life: but
for what I call occasional likings they can run from one
to another with great ease and dexterity. Now what I
think the most difficult in these affairs is to satisfie
others in our conduct, for there is as you observe, in the
heart of male and female a principle of vanity and self-love
that makes us unwillingly give way to a preference
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_113">[113]</span>in any thing, and we are very apt to comfort ourselves
with thinking, and sometimes saying, that the preference
given is not from greater perfections, but from greater
encouragement, ‘some people set themselves out, and
pay a court I cannot,’ when we are all doing our best to
gain this descried admiration, and vexed, even to make
us unjust when we fail. In short, and when I view
human nature in some lights, I can almost forgive
Swift’s Yahoos. But to the point. I should think the
behaviour on these occasions should be as easy as we
can, and we should be pretty sure there is a passion
growing in the heart before we make an alteration that
can be perceived by the person concerned, and as for
the by-slanderers, I should endeavour to convince them
I did not desire such a conquest, but at the same time,
I would not let them think they could easily persuade
me I had made it. I would converse as usual in public,
but I would avoid private conversations, lest others
should think I sought them, but these are things I am
sure you can think of better than I can, and must be
practised as circumstances suit. The person said nothing
here but what was extremely proper, we talked of you
all, and you and another were commended with great
elegance, and for the third they said they did not know
them enough to give an opinion.</p>

<p>“Now my dear Friend a word about the desire that
is natural in most females to make lovers, if you meet
with a person who you think would be proper to make
you happy in the married state, and they show a desire
to please you, and a solidity in their liking, give it the
proper encouragement that the decency of our sex will
allow of, for it is the settlement in the world we should
aim at, and the only way we females have of making
ourselves of use to Society and raising ourselves in this
world; but for lovers merely for being courted and
admired they are of no real use, and often prove a great
detriment both by their own malice of disappointment
and their jealousy of others, and for a friendship of any
tenderness between disengaged persons of different sexes<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_114">[114]</span>
I am afraid there is no such thing, so do not be caught
by that deceitful bait. Esteem and regard may be without
passion, but tenderness and confidence, and what
we call friendship among ourselves, will, with opportunity,
turn to desire in the different sexes. We desire
to possess a friend to know their heart, to be in their
thoughts, this must turn to passion between the sexes,
I think ’tis impossible to be otherwise, and I could
express it more philosophically but you will do it for
me. Now pardon me this impertinent letter, there are
not those in the world to whom I would write so freely,
for I do not know those who I think have sense and
goodness of heart, to bear advice: the only merit of
mine is its sincerity and affection, and having seen more
years has given me many opportunities of seeing the
world of love, with all its mischiefs. Adieu, burn this,
and love me as I do you most sincerely.</p>

<p>“P.S.—I will say no more of Books till we meet,
though I must wonder at the want of discernment in
those who can read an Author who is all fiction, and
take it for certain truth.”</p>

be suspicious that they are designed as a reproof to me
for the deplorable state under which she passed twenty-three

all her endeavours to give to you an equal share, which
I think you have at least a right to. We hope you enjoy

<p class="para1">“I should have paid my compliments earlier on
the joyful occasion of your marriage if I had known
whither to address them; for your brother’s letter which
informed me, happened to lie several days at Cambridge,
before it came to my hands. My congratulation, however,
though late, wants nothing of the warmth with
which the earliest was accompanied; for I must beg
leave to assure you that I take a real part in the present
joy of your family, and feel a kind of paternal<a id="1_FNanchor_235" href="#1_Footnote_235" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 235">[235]</a> pleasure,
from the good fortune of one whose amiable qualities I
have been a witness of from her tenderest years, and to
whom I have ever been wishing and ominating everything
that is good. I have always expected from your
singular merit and accomplishments that they would recommend
you in proper time to an advantageous and
honourable match; and was assured from your prudence
that it would never suffer you to accept any which was
not worthy of you; so that it gives me not only the
greatest pleasure on your account, but a sort of pride also
on my own, to see my expectations so fully answered,
and my predictions of you so literally fulfilled. As all conjugal
happiness is founded on mutual affection, cherished
by good sense, so you have the fairest prospect of it now
open before you, by your marriage with a gentleman,
not only of figure and fortune, but of great knowledge
and understanding, who values you, not so much for the
charms of your person, as the beauties of your mind,
which will always give you the surest hold of him, as
they will every day be gathering strength, whilst the
others are daily losing it. But I should make a sad<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_120">[120]</span>
compliment to a blooming bride if I meant to exclude
her person from contributing any part to her nuptial
happiness; that is far from my meaning; and yours
Madam, I am sure, could not fail of having its full share
in acquiring your husband’s affection. What I would
inculcate therefore, is only this: that though beauty has
the greatest force to conciliate affection, yet it cannot
preserve it without the help of the mind; and whatever
the perfection of the one may be, the accomplishments
of the other will always be the more amiable; and in the
married state especially, will be found after all, the most
solid and lasting basis of domestic comfort. But I am
using the privilege of my years, and instead of compliments,
giving lessons to one who does not want them.
I shall only add, therefore, my repeated wishes for all
the joy that matrimony can give you and Mr. Montagu,
to whose worthy character I am no stranger, though I
have not the honour to be known to him in person, and
am with sincere respect,</p>

<p>Here I make some extracts from Mrs. Montagu’s
second letter to her beloved Duchess of Portland, dated
August 21, 1742, from Allerthorpe, Mr. Montagu’s Yorkshire
seat—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Tuesday I arrived at this place, not tired
with my journey, but satisfied therewith. As far as
Nottingham you will travel very soon, and then as far
as Doncaster, therefore it will be but impertinent to
give you an account of the road or anything concerning
it. I will only tell your Grace I saw Nottingham

the wisdom and the riches of your ancestors. As we
came nearer to this place, the country grew more wild,
but not less beautiful; we came through some rivers
that charmed me beyond all things.... We have at
present very fine weather, the sun gilds every object,
and I assure you it is the only fine thing we have
here, for the house is old and not handsome: it is
very convenient, and the situation extremely pleasant.
We found the finest peaches, nectarines and apricots,
that I have ever eat: your Grace will think I mean
turnips, carrots and parsnips; but really and truly they
are apricots, peaches and nectarines. To-morrow, I
believe will be one of the happiest days I ever spent,
I am to go to fetch my brothers from school. How
delightful will be such a meeting after so many years’
separation.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LITTLE BROTHERS</div>

<p>These were her three youngest brothers, William,
John, and Charles, who had been five years at school at
Scorton, without coming home. Mr. Montagu, eager to
gratify his bride’s love of her family, had allowed her to
have them to stay, and ever afterwards he was their
constant friend and benefactor. Further on in the letter
she states that it took them “six days with very easy
stages” to reach Allerthorpe from London! In the next
letter she states that her little brothers being “sensible,
good-natured, and sober, the most affectionate towards
each other of any children of their age I ever saw:
they have very good characters at school, both as to
their learning and behaviour; but the quintessence of
perfection is my brother Jack.”</p>

<p>At the end of this letter she mentions her old friend,
Miss Cally Scott, of Scott’s Hall, was going to be married
to Mr. Best, a man of fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_122">[122]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REV. MATTHEW ROBINSON</div>

<p>On August 25 she writes to her cousin, Mrs.
Freind—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Cousin, I am ashamed I have not before
answered your kind letter and returned thanks for those
good wishes of whose accomplishments I hope there
is the fairest prospect: I think we increase in esteem
without decaying in complaisance, and I hope we shall
always remember Mr. Freind and the fifth of August
with thankfulness. I am infinitely obliged to Mr. Freind
for not letting the knot be tied by the hands of an
ordinary bungler; he was very good in coming to London
on purpose, but he did not give his last benediction, but
stole away before my sister or any of us were come
downstairs.</p>

<p>“We arrived at this place after a journey of six
days through fine countries, where the riches of Harvest
promised luxury to the Landlord, plenty to the farmer
and food to the labourer. Here we are situated in a
fine country, and Mr. Montagu has the pleasure of calling
many hundred pounds a year about his house his
own, without any person’s property interfering with it:
I think it is the prettiest estate, and in the best order I
ever saw; large and beautiful meadows for riding or
walking in, with a pretty river<a id="1_FNanchor_237" href="#1_Footnote_237" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 237">[237]</a> winding about them,
upon which we shall sometimes go out in boats.</p>

<p>“In this parish Dr. Robinson,<a id="1_FNanchor_238" href="#1_Footnote_238" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 238">[238]</a> our general Uncle,
has founded a school and an Alms House where the
young are taught industry, the old, content: I propose
to visit the Alms House very soon. I saw the old
women with the Bucks upon their sleeves at Church,
and it gave me pleasure. Heraldry<a id="1_FNanchor_239" href="#1_Footnote_239" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 239">[239]</a> does not always
descend with such honour, as when Charity leads her by
the hand. Our uncle did this good while he was <em>alive</em>;<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_123">[123]</span>
it was not that Soul thrift that would save itself with
another’s money.</p>

<p>“I hope you will forgive my not having written to you
before, but a new family, and a new place must take up
one’s time. Our house here is tolerably convenient, and
that is all that can be said for it. We have a better
which I hope you will often see in Berkshire.<a id="1_FNanchor_240" href="#1_Footnote_240" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 240">[240]</a> Pray

<div class="sidenote">FIRST LETTER TO MR. MONTAGU</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu having left Elizabeth for a few days
for business at Newcastle, she writes to him—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How very fortunate are those few who in the
Person they love, meet with the principles of Honour
and Virtue to guide them through the World, but this,
my fortune, so happy and so rare, shall not breed in me
that insolence of opinion that I deserve it, but I will
still look up to Heaven and you with gratitude and
continual acknowledgments.”</p>
</div>

<p>This sufficiently indicates the happiness and mutual
confidence reigning between the newly wedded pair.</p>

<p>On October 2 Dr. Conyers Middleton wrote Mrs.
Montagu a long letter, mainly a dissertation on marriage
and its duties. He alludes to his pleasure at her having
her three youngest brothers with her, calling them
“<i lang="fr">enfans trouvés</i> by a sister unknown to them,” and
he adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall always think myself particularly interested
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_124">[124]</span>in their success, for they were all born under my roof,
which may, one day perhaps, derive an accession of fame
from that circumstance. If I should live to see any of
them in the University, it would be a pleasure to me to
do everything in my power that might be of use to
their improvement.”</p>
</div>

<p>This shows that Mrs. Robinson had been accustomed
to stay with her mother, the first Mrs. Middleton, for her
latter frequent confinements, though Elizabeth and some
of the elder sons were born at York. Dr. Middleton
begs Mr. and Mrs. Montagu to pay him a visit at
Cambridge on their return to London, and states, “This
university had the honour of Mr. Montagu’s education,
and claims some share in yours.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">PÈRE LE COURAYER —<br>
WORKSOP</div>

<p>Being detained by business in the north, Mrs.
Montagu wrote to Mrs. Donnellan to send her a
winter mantle and muff, and as prices of those times
may interest my readers, I will mention the blue
velvet mantle cost £5, the ermine muff one guinea. In
Mrs. Donnellan’s letter the Père Courayer sends his
compliments and good wishes to Mrs. Montagu. As he
figures much in later letters, I give a short sketch of his
biography. Peter Francis le Courayer was born in
1681, and was a Normandy ecclesiastic; although a
Roman Catholic, he had the courage to defend the
ordinances of the English Church, for which the Pope
censured him severely. He left France for England,
and went to Oxford, where he lodged with Mrs. Chenevix,
the famous toy-woman. He was made LL.D., and
translated <cite>Father Paul’s “History of the Council of
Trent,”</cite> also <cite>Sleidan’s “History of the Reformation.”</cite>
He was well known to Horace Walpole. He died
in 1776. His pet-name was “the little Père.” In a letter
of the duchess’s of October 9 from Welbeck, where she
was visiting her mother, Lady Oxford, she says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_125">[125]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mamma was so obliging last week as to carry us to

The gardener told me he had planted last year 300,000
Forest trees, besides sowing three score bushels of seeds.
The approach to the house is fine. I don’t like the house
though it was built by Bess of Harwicke, whose wisdom
I have in great reverence: the best apartment is up two
pair of stairs, the additional offices lately built are
exceedingly good, the Dairy much prettier than that
we saw at Richmond. The servant told us the Duchess
gave the chief direction for the building, had planted
those woods, had drawn the plan for that piece of water
of 120 acres. The Duke’s time is chiefly occupied with
drawing plans for Bee hives! With difficulty I kept my
countenance....</p>

<p>From Allerthorpe the Montagus visited Mr. Buckley<a id="1_FNanchor_244" href="#1_Footnote_244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 244">[244]</a>
at Bishop’s Dale, near which place Mr. Robinson
in former days had lived in the shooting season. Elizabeth
had not been there for fifteen years. She describes
to the Duchess of Portland the country—</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a id="1_Footnote_244" href="#1_FNanchor_244" title="Return to text.">[244]</a> Mr. Buckley had been a second father to the three little
Robinson boys, who spent their holidays with him.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had been three days upon an expedition to a wild
part of the country called the Dales, where Nature’s
works are not delicate, pretty and mignonne, but grand,
sublime and magnificent. Vast mountains, rocks and
cascades, and rapid rivers make the country beautiful
and surprising. We went to a farm abounding in
wonders, a high hill with some hanging wood before it,
behind it a large and rapid river with the prospect of<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_126">[126]</span>
a huge cascade, an old Castle and a Church. Some
houses in view take from it the honour of absolute
solitude: a range of rocks appears like the ruins of an
old town on the other side of the river. In a cottage
built in this charming place, lives an old woman, who
has attained to an hundred and four years, and for this
long lease of life, has not exchanged the best comfort.
She enjoys good health, tolerable strength, has her
hearing perfect, and her sight very well: is cheerful and
has not lost her reason, but answers with sense and
spirit, her hair is of a fine black: she was knitting when
we went to her, and has promised to knit me a pair of
stockings in a month.</p>

<p>“My Father had a house in this part of the world for
the summer sports of shooting and fishing, so that the
old woman and I had been well acquainted 15 years ago,
and she told me laughing she imagined I did not expect
to see her alive at this time....</p>

<p>“Tell Père Courayer<a id="1_FNanchor_245" href="#1_Footnote_245" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 245">[245]</a> my head is as much troubled
with chimeras and giddiness as ever. I fear he is too
fond of variety in life to be a friend to Matrimony. The
merriest man I have seen in Yorkshire is a Frenchman,
who came here for religion, and has had the needful of
life added unto him; he has a little estate, and lives with
the mountain nymphs, Liberty and Health, in the
Dales; he amuses himself with singing to his grandchildren,
mending his clothes, and making soup: his
grandson eats soup with him, and his next darling, <i>le
petit chat</i>, helps him off with the Bouillie. He can not
only make a fine dish of the cabbage, but of the snails
and caterpillars, and what we call the unprofitable
vermin that live upon it! There was not a creature in
Noah’s Ark that would not be received into his larder,
for a Frenchman is seldom so proud of stomach as to
term anything unclean....</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu was a Whig, but, as his wife states, a

Huntingdon was irreproachably upright in a most venal
age. What respect his wife already had for his judgment
is shown in a letter from her to him in London,
whither he had gone for the meeting of Parliament on
October 16, enclosing her reply to Dr. Conyers Middleton’s
letter, desiring him, if he did not approve of it,
to burn it, and she would write another. The following
passage speaks volumes for Mrs. Montagu’s humility

take the trouble to read it, for it is with some uneasiness

<p>Elizabeth was now in an interesting condition, and
as Dr. Sandys forbade her travelling for a time, she<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_128">[128]</span>
and Sarah remained at Allerthorpe. The joy of Mr.
Montagu was extreme at the idea of an heir, which
was shared by his sister, Mrs. Medows, and all his
relations. Elizabeth, though pleased at the prospect,
was very <i>souffrante</i>, and bored by an inactive life, yet
submitted to it with a good grace.</p>

<p>At this period her brother Robert was made captain
of an East India vessel travelling to China, to his
family’s satisfaction.</p>

finer than Sir Hans Sloane’s. In particular he has a
mummy much finer preserved. It is the custom to gild
their faces, so that all the features are painted over the
gold.... Of all the things, except the pictures, which
are exquisitely fine, none pleases me more than a mask
in bronze, which is exceeding fine workmanship, and has
upon it the symbols of all the gods. The crown of vine
for Bacchus, a circle of iron for Pluto, the ears of Pan,

I have heard from France a great while, and the only

yours to my sister. I have not seen her but am sure
she thinks herself much obliged, as all must do who
have the happiness of a correspondence with you, whose
letters not only please by their wit and vivacity, but are
full of sincerity and friendship, of virtue and goodness,
which you set in so true and amiable a light, that if
those that read them grow not wiser and better, it is
none of your fault.</p>

<p>“I rejoice at the good account you give of your health,
that you suffer less and less every day. I wish j could
prevent your suffering at all. The prudent care you
take obliges me in the highest degree, and j hope with
the assistance of your happy and chearful disposition of
mind, preserve you from any misfortune. Though j
most eagerly long to see you, j would have you run no
hazard, and will content myself till we break up, when j
hope neither bad roads nor bad weather shall hinder
me coming to you: till then j desire you to spend your
time as agreeably as you can, and am glad Mrs. Yorke
and Mrs. Clayton are to make you a visit.</p>

<p>“I waited on Mrs. Donnellan this morning, yesterday
was not convenient for her, and could not do it
before. I paid her the bill which j send enclos’d and
a guinea more for your muffe, so that out of ye six
guineas j shall owe you five shillings. She expressed
herself much obliged, and desired her compliments to
you, and both to you and Miss Salley.</p>

those they are so much obliged to, and when they come
from Burton, if they spend the rest of their time with
you, there will be no harm in it, nor will it hinder them
in their learning, as they are designed for another

do all j can to serve him, and after j have made inquiry
about the manner of doing it, will write to his Father.</p>

<p>“I am now in the highest content: my little brothers

<div class="sidenote">HER HUSBAND’S CHARACTER</div>

<p>About this time Elizabeth writes a long letter to
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Freind, her cousin, portions of which
I give. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The last and best good office you did me, I believe,
will claim my thanks to the longest day of my life....
I know it will please you to hear that I have, every day
since you made me a wife, had more reason to thank you
for the alteration. I have the honour and happiness to
be made the guest of a heart furnished with the best and
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_132">[132]</span>greatest virtues, honesty, integrity and universal benevolence,
with the most engaging affection to every one
who particularly belongs to him. No desire of power,
but to do good, no use of it but to make happy. I cannot
be so unjustly diffident as to doubt of the duration of
my happiness, when I see the author of it dispensing
content to all his dependants, and should he ever cease
to use me with more care and generosity and affection
than I deserve, I should be the first person he has ever
treated in this manner. Since I married I have never
heard him say an ill-natured word to any one, or have I
received one matrimonial frown. His generous affection
in loving all my friends, and desiring every opportunity
for my conversing with them, is very obliging to me.
We have often pleased ourselves with the hopes of
seeing you frequently in Dover Street this winter; but
alas, I am a prisoner at Allerthorpe, and the worst of
prisoners confined by infirmities and ill health.</p>

<p>“Mr. Montagu went to Parliament ten days ago to
my mortification, but with my approbation. I desired
him to go, and half wished him to stay! I knew his
righteous star would rule his destiny, so I helped him
on with honour’s boots, and let him go without murmuring.
He left me my sister, and where she is there will
happiness be also.... We have not been troubled with
any visitor since Mr. M. went away, and could you see
how ignorant, how awkward, how absurd, and how uncouth
the generality of people are in this country, you
would look upon this as a piece of good fortune....</p>

<p>“I am very happy in one thing, that drinking is not
within our walls; we have not had one person disordered
by liquor since we came down, though most of
the poor ladies have had more Hogs in their dining
rooms than ever they had in their hog stye....</p>

<div class="sidenote">“NIGHT THOUGHTS”</div>

<p>The Duchess of Portland, on December 4, writes in
great annoyance at some of her letters being lost. She
was much worried about the health of her mother, who
suffered severely from cramp in the stomach. She
desires Elizabeth to write a <em>visible</em><a id="1_FNanchor_254" href="#1_Footnote_254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 254">[254]</a> letter to cheer Lady
Oxford, and adds, “I rejoice you are better. I hope
you have left off footing it and tumbling downstairs.
Have you read ‘<cite>Night Thoughts</cite>’? If you have, I beg
you will give me your opinion of it.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="1_Footnote_254" href="#1_FNanchor_254" title="Return to text.">[254]</a> Often the familiar letters were enclosed to Mrs. Elstob, a
learned lady and authoress, who was now governess to the Portland
children. Lady Oxford was then at Bullstrode.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Young had lost his beloved wife, his step-son
and step-daughter the year before. The step-daughter
died of consumption, brought on by grief at her mother’s
loss. Her step-father had taken her abroad for her
health. She died at Montpellier, and was refused
Christian burial by the bigoted French of those days.
The poor doctor, assisted by his servant, dug her grave
in a field, unaided by any one. Can any one wonder at
the gloom pervading the poem?</p>

<p>Whilst the duchess is writing to Mrs. Montagu, the
latter writes on December 5—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Madam, after being sunk into stupidity by the
company of a strange kind of animal called a country
Beau and wit, how unfit am I for conversation of the
Duchess of Portland!”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A ROUÉ OF THE PERIOD</div>

<p>She then proceeds to draw this curious picture of a
country beau,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“who cannot attain the perfection of a monkey, even the
art of mimicry.... Had you seen the pains this animal
has been taking to imitate the cringe of a beau, the
smartness of a wit, till he was hideous to behold, and
horrible to hear, you would have pitied him! He walks
like a tortoise, and chatters like a magpye: by the
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_134">[134]</span>indulgence of a kind mother, and the advantage of a country
education, he was first a clown, then he was sent to the
Inns of Court, where he first fell into a red waistcoat
and velvet breeches; then into vanity. This light companion
led him to the play house, where he ostentiously
coquetted with the orange wenches, who cured him of
the bel-air of taking snuff by abridging him of his
nostrils, grown even in his own eyes no very lovely
figure; he thought Bacchus, no critic in faces, would
prove in the end a better friend than Cupid: accordingly
he fell into the company of the jovial, till want of money
and want of taste led this prodigal son, if not to eat, to
drink with swine. He visited the prisons, not as a comforter,
but as a companion to criminals; shook hands
with the gold finder, and walked in the ways of the
scavenger; so singular his humility, none were his contempt.
At last, having lost his money, ruined his constitution,
and lost all the sense nature gave him, he
returned to the country where all the youths of inferior
rank, admiring his experience, and emulating his qualities,
and copying his manners, grew, some fit for jail, others
for transportation.... Notwithstanding all these vices
and the most nauseous effect of them, all people treat
him civilly!”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu writes to his wife on December 9,<a id="1_FNanchor_255" href="#1_Footnote_255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 255">[255]</a> and
in it he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tomorrow the affair of the Hanover troops<a id="1_FNanchor_256" href="#1_Footnote_256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 256">[256]</a> comes
on, and will be carried, which is the worst that ever
came before the House, of which j shall give you an
account in my next letter, and send you several
pamphlets well worth your reading about that, and the
present state of affairs.”</p>
</div>

<p>Writing again from his house in Dover Street,
London, on December 20, he says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Tuesday we met at Westminster, where his
Majesty opened the session with a most gracious speech
from the throne, which j hope you have got, as you shall
have the addresses of both Houses sent by this post.
You will easily perceive what was aimed at by the
speech, and that by the addresses both the Lords and
Commons have most dutifully consented to take 16,000
Hanover troops into our pay. This was openly avowed
by Lord Carteret<a id="1_FNanchor_257" href="#1_Footnote_257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 257">[257]</a> in the Upper House, and by those
who made the motion in the Lower. After a debate
which lasted till between 10 and 11 at night our address
was carried by a majority of 109, the numbers being
150 and 259. By that stroke England is become a
province to Hanover, the charge of the military part
of its government already being flung upon us (for who
shall tell when we shall get rid of this burthen?) or how
soon we shall feel the additional part of the same?
The late ministry never attempted anything like it, and
it shows that the new one will stick at nothing to
recommend themselves to the King, the Devil in Milton,
‘<em>with one bound, high overleapt all bound</em>.’... The number
of those that love their country truly, always was and ever
will be but small, and the Saints never yet governed the
Earth, and I believe never will, but true patriotism is not
the less a virtue for that, nor must its votaries leave off
their endeavours or be discouraged at whatever happens.”</p>

<p>It will hardly be credited that the country apothecary

Montagu. Fortunately, his throat getting better, he
did not use it, to Mrs. Montagu’s relief, who says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Had he swallowed it I should have thought there
was love powder in it, for he said a thousand pretty
things to her, with an air of great tenderness, and indeed
had he taken the bolus I believe no man could have been
nearer dying for a lady. The recipe had been given her
by an ancient maiden, who having said in her sorrow all

<p>Mr. Montagu was still detained in London, not only
by his parliamentary duties, but for a Chancery suit.
He writes on December 21, lamenting the long separation
“from the ardent object of his desires,” but pleased
to think that the doctor will soon give her permission to<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_137">[137]</span>
join him in London. This passage throws light on law
suits of that day—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our petition, as we were made to expect, was to
have been heard this day, but the Lord Chancellor who
has, j think, much more business than any one man can
go through as he ought to do, had so many petitions
that it is thought impossible it should come on sooner
than tomorrow, and may not be till near the beginning
of next term. Part of his Lordship’s time is this day
taken up by his attendance on the King, who comes to
the House of Lords to pass some money bills, in all his
royal pageantry and show. Things of this nature add
a great deal to the plague, expense and delay of Law,
especially in the Court of Chancery. If we are not
heard tomorrow in the forenoon j shall be deprived of
your brother’s<a id="1_FNanchor_261" href="#1_Footnote_261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 261">[261]</a> assistance, who was so good as to come
post from Canterbury on Sunday last on purpose, and
must set out again for the same place at noon tomorrow....
This day the House of Commons are to be adjourned
till after the hollydays, and it is talked that the
Session will be at an end by the beginning of March.
The opposition has been carried on with a great deal of
Spirit and will be continued to be so after Xmas, as it is
given out. They intend to make a new ministry wade
through more mire, though they have gone through so
much already. They have got themselves more enemies
in the short time they have been in, than Lord Orford
in his long reign, for they are ruining their country
faster than ever he did, and this infamous job of the
Hanoverian Troops, it’s thought was what he never
would give way to. Several of our young Members
have greatly distinguished themselves by their opposition,
and made it appear that there is no want of the

Mr. Murray,<a id="1_FNanchor_263" href="#1_Footnote_263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 263">[263]</a> who has been brought into the House on

bear in so good a manner, that he gave nobody offence,

himself, if not with more advantage to their cause....</p>

<p>In writing to the Duchess of Portland on December 28
to wish her a happy new year, Mrs. Montagu informs
her she has permission from Dr. Sandys to move towards
London in a fortnight’s time. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall move as slowly as a fat corpse in a herse.
Your grace asks me if I have left off footing and tumbling
down stairs; as to the first, my fidgetations are much
spoiled, sometimes I have cut a thoughtless caper which
has gone to the heart of an old Steward of Mr. Montagu’s,
who is as honest as ‘Trusty’ in the play of <i>Grief à la
Mode</i>. I am told he has never heard a hop that he has
not echoed with a groan. I have taken such heed to
my goings I have not gone down stairs more than by
gradual degrees.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following passage from a letter of Mrs. Donnellan’s
to Mrs. Montagu shows the price paid for
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_139">[139]</span>embroidery of flowers which was much used at this
time on dresses. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have spoken to Jenny Clegg about your sack.
She always works according to the price, the slightest
trimming down to the bottom, of natural flowers she
says will be £8, and the handsomest £12, and between
in proportion. I gave her 4 guineas for my apron, and
she has always three and a half or four for the robings
and facings of a night dress.”</p>
</div>

<p>A “night dress” was what we should call an <i>evening
dress</i> now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A COOK</div>

<p>In a letter to Mrs. Donnellan a light is thrown on
that ever-important functionary, a cook. That individual
being required, Mrs. Donnellan had mentioned a cook
who had been with Lady Selina Bathurst. Mrs. Montagu
writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As to the Cook being an Irish woman, I think it
can be no objection to me who prefer a lady<a id="1_FNanchor_266" href="#1_Footnote_266" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 266">[266]</a> of that
country to almost any one of our own; she being a good
catholick is not much, but I think it will not be right to
take her unless Lady Selina Bathurst says she is a good
cook, for had she all the cardinal virtues, and could not
fricasy (<i>sic</i>) and make good soop (<i>sic</i>) I should not know
what to do with her. I would give £15 a year to a very
good cook, but if she is not above being improved, and
I could get her to go into the King’s kitchen, or to any
famous Tavern to learn cookery, I would give a guinea
or two for her teaching, and I heard that in the places
I mention they will take in a person upon such terms.
I suppose she will dress meat on fast days? I like the
character of the woman provided she has had the smallpox,
as I would not have any person in the house who
might run me into the hazard.”</p>
</div>

<div class="footnotes">

<p>The three Robinson boys were taken by young Mr.
Edward Carter to York, placed in the coach to London,<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_140">[140]</span>
and were met by Griffith, a valet of Mr. Montagu’s in
London, Mr. Montagu taking them in in Dover Street,
and despatching them with a servant to Canterbury, <i>en
route</i> for Mount Morris.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANCERY SUIT</div>

<p>On December 28 Mrs. Montagu writes to her husband
she trusts to set out for London on January 9, and hopes
to accomplish the journey in ten or eleven days! The
Chancery suit had been deferred till January 13. A
letter of Thomas Robinson’s regretting his inability to
leave the Kentish Sessions held at Maidstone contains
this passage, “I have already two or three retainers
for that day, and have generally the good fortune to be
employed in every cause, which makes the gains of the
day considerable.”... He winds up with saying he has
delivered his brief of the Montagu case to Mr. Fawcet,
who, he is sure, will make better use of it than he
should.</p>

<p>And so ends the year 1742.</p>

<div class="from1 s9">“Doncaster, Saturday the 8,</div>

<p class="smcap">“Dear Madam,</p>

<p class="para1">“I arrived here this evening, without having
suffer’d any inconvenience or fatigue in my whole progress.
We were met on Thursday in Leeming Lane<a id="1_FNanchor_267" href="#1_Footnote_267" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 267">[267]</a>
by a Messenger from Capt. Twycross to tell us the
waters were out at Burroughbridge, and that we could
not pass them, so I apply’d to my guide, Mr. Carter, and
a wise man is certainly never out of his element. He
told me I might go to Kirby Hill and there get a warm
lodging, though not an elegant one; which he thought<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_142">[142]</span>
would be as well as turning back. For my part I assured
him I had rather have my bed stuffed with flocks than
my pillow with care and disappointment, and agreed
to go on to the place he mentioned, and then send a
messenger to see if the waters were fallen. The Dove
returned with an olive branch, and we went on to the
Waterside<a id="1_FNanchor_268" href="#1_Footnote_268" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 268">[268]</a> there to prevent fear (for danger there was
none), we got into a boat and navigated through Mr.
Williamson’s gardens, his melancholy yews just shew’d
their formal heads above the water. Himself a melancholy
shade too, was almost in as bad a way, for the
water was quite to his door, so he could get no amusement
from the rest of the world, but what he saw from
the windows. We were safely landed at the door of the
Inn. The coach came through the water without getting
any wet inside of it, and we all rejoiced that we had been
more afraid than hurt. Mr. Carter, in his care, often
bid me be of good courage; as there was not occasion
for any, I could not be disgraced for want of it: from
our first setting out I have not been less entertain’d
than guarded by him, he has really acted the part of
Sir Roger de Coverley all the way; his benevolent heart
breaks into such honest and affectionate expressions, you
would think he was talking to his family wherever he
is; at the ‘Oak-tree’ he was, I saw, shaking hands with
every creature. I stopp’d to speak to a servant of Mrs.
Yorke’s who met us with her compliments, and could
hear Mr. Carter praising the strong beer, thanking the
Landlord, wishing many good things to a boy who was
stuffing a luncheon of bread and butter, thanking Heaven
for good weather, and commending the road, all in a
breath. At Lord Castlecomer’s Inn he would stop for
the horses to eat, he said a sort of grace to it, praying it
might strengthen them to the end of their journey, then
he extolled the Inn, the Landlord and his wife, not forgetting
a ‘lile lass’ that stood at the gate: all the way
we went in the boat he commended the boatmen more
than an envious person would have done Christopher<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_143">[143]</span>
Columbus, for exploring leas and lands unknown; at
Borough Bridge he made the funeral Elogy of Mr. Mann,
but not to wrong the living for the sake of the dead, he
said the handsomest things to mine Hostess, the civilest
things to her daughters, the most honourable things of
her son, and the most affable things to the chambermaid,
that ever I heard in my life. At Aberforth he was not
less kind to every creature, nor less indulgent to every
thing, and he is the same still, and I doubt not but will
be Sir Roger de Coverley to the end of the journey. I
am really pleased by reflection, and though I don’t see
everything in his point of view, I am delighted at his
happiness, like the bee he gathers honey from every
flower, nay, weed, which to common taste have no perfection.
I wish I could think as well of all mankind as
he does; but he deserves to think better of it. Benevolence
is built so much on faith, that those who think
very ill of people in general, will never do them much
good, for service often arises from trust, and we cannot
trust those whom we dare not believe.”</p>

<p>Old Mr. Rogers had bought East Denton land and
collieries for £10,900 from the Erringtons in 1689, who
had long had the property. In December, 1705, Mr.
Rogers bought of Sir James Clavering his share of
the West Denton property. The history of Denton Hall
will be given further on. Young John Rogers appears<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_145">[145]</span>
to have had fits as early as 1718. He married in 1713,
Anne Delaval, who died in 1723 at Seaton Delaval,
and he seems to have become deranged soon after
her death. As long as his mother lived he was well
cared for, but she died in 1733, and the last nine years
he had been gradually getting worse, and a set of
designing people surrounded him. I have a letter of
his written to his parents, apparently on going to
Oxford in 1705, which is so curious that I insert it here.
It is addressed—</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. MONTAGU’S JOURNEY</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu was made guardian and manager to
Mr. Rogers and his estate. Uneasy as he was at leaving
his wife in her present situation, he was obliged to go
to Newcastle to see into affairs. Sarah Robinson, who
had gone home, was quickly summoned to return to her
sister, to which her parents rather unwillingly gave their
consent. Mr. Montagu writes each post, as often as he
could, most affectionate letters to his wife; as he rode
all the way, disliking a carriage, we see by his letters
the time the journey took. March 19, he writes from
Nottingham, having been four days reaching there. He
says, “If j was mounted as j ought to be j could without
much difficulty reach Allerthorpe on Monday night,
whereas j must now be content if j get there some time
on Tuesday.” He bids her divert herself with her friends
and acquaintances, and to send him good accounts of
her health, “as there is nothing under Heaven that is so
dear to me.”</p>

<p>But no sooner had Mr. Montagu set out than the
Duchess of Portland lost her youngest daughter Frances,
just two years old, from convulsions after whooping
cough. She forbade Mrs. Montagu coming to see her
at first, for fear of her grief affecting her in her present
condition. Mrs. Donnellan and Mrs. Pendarves were
with the duchess, and did all they could to solace her
grief, which was intense. After a few days, however,
the two friends met, and had a sad meeting.</p>

<p>To return to Mr. Montagu’s travels, he got to<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_147">[147]</span>
Allerthorpe, where Mr. Carter joined him, and they
proceeded to Newcastle, to Mr. Rogers’ house, where</p>

diligence of Mr. Carter in the despatch we
have made than to everything else put together. We
have found Bonds amounting to near £10,000 value.”</p>
</div>

<p>A general oversight was arranged to be taken by
Mr. Carter of the estates and tenants, many of the
latter being heavily in arrears in rents. It is characteristic
of Mr. Montagu’s uprightness in business that,
though not obliged to do so, he rendered to Sir James
Clavering, Mr. Rogers’ uncle, a complete account of
his estate, of which Sir James greatly approved, and
regretted these steps were not taken ten years before.
A Mr. Grey was put in charge of Mr. Rogers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DARNTON FAIR</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu and Mr. Carter commenced their
journey home, the latter going to Darnton Fair <i>en
route</i>. People rose early for business then. Mr. Montagu
states Mr. Carter “sat up late last night and rose this
morning at 3, and set out at 6 for Bedale, where he will
be occupied all day.” He adds, “He is unwearied, j
never knew his fellow. He has lived three times as
much as any other man no older than he, and has done
three times as much business and benefited many and
hurt none. I wish j could say as much of those who
are in a rank of life infinitely superior to him.” Truly
this is a fine picture of a righteous steward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BIRTH OF A SON</div>

<p>By May 1, when Elizabeth writes to her mother, Mr.
Montagu had returned to her, she and her sister meeting
him at Highgate. Mention is made in this letter of Miss
Brockman having become temporarily speechless from<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_148">[148]</span>
inoculation. Sarah returns to Mount Morris, and the last
letter before Mrs. Montagu’s confinement tells of the
purchase of a “magnifique Berceau” just in time, as on
May 11 Mrs. Montagu gave birth, at their house in Dover
Street, to a fine boy, to the infinite joy of Mr. Montagu
and his sister, Mrs. Medows. A young farmer’s wife, a
Mrs. Kennet, living near Mount Morris, had been engaged
as a wet-nurse to the child.</p>

<p>On May 30 the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Freind, to whom Mr.
Montagu had written to announce the birth of his child,
writes to congratulate him, and to say Mrs. Freind had
presented him with a daughter that morning. Mr.
Montagu had promised to stand godfather if it was
a boy,<a id="1_FNanchor_272" href="#1_Footnote_272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 272">[272]</a> but if a daughter Mrs. Montagu was to be
godmother. To this letter, on June 4, Mr. Montagu
replied that his wife and child are doing well, and he
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The latter end of next week we intend for the
baptism of our infant, and if you were here should be
prouder to have the ceremony performed by you than
anybody else, for if j may judge from what has happened
to the Father, j imagine it would be auspicious to the
Son. I am sure j ought never to forget the share you

<div class="sidenote">INOCULATION</div>

<p>The reader will remember that Mrs. Montagu was<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_149">[149]</span>
peculiarly afraid of smallpox, but she had determined,
if once a mother, she would be inoculated, so that she
should be able to attend to her child if it ever had the
disease, and to prevent separation from or infection to
it if she herself took the disease in the natural manner.
When her dread of it is recollected, it will appear a
heroic deed on her part. Her mother, Mrs. Robinson,
was far from easy at the idea of the inoculation taking
place in the summer heat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the little boy was christened John, though
he soon acquired the nickname of “Punch,” their own
familiar peep-show, as the fond parents deemed him,
and is only twice mentioned in the letters I have as my
little “Jack.”</p>

<p>In a letter of June 21, from the Duchess of Portland,
who was at Welbeck with Lady Oxford, she mentions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Duke of Kingston<a id="1_FNanchor_275" href="#1_Footnote_275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 275">[275]</a> has been in the utmost

part of a night, not without the assistance of Barbecued
Hog, Tokay, etc., etc., etc. to keep up his spirits, to
enable him to go through the immense fatigue of waking
a few hours with his patron.” She adds, “Thank God
the children are all well. I hope your little man is so,
my best wishes must ever attend the dear boy.”</p>

as ‘Mirth with thee I chose to live,’ I am glad it is of

not appear in this little paradise. There is a charming

may allegorize like Spenser, or pastoralize like the lesser
poets, there are roses and honeysuckles hourly dropping
to put you in mind ‘how small a part of time they
share, that are so wondrous sweet and fair,’ and this
will whisper to you ‘de coglier d’amor la rosa,’ indeed,
my dear Sall, these pretty things are mere toys, as are
all things in this world, but a true friend. I am thankful
for the benefits of fortune, and pleased with them, but
really attached only to the person who bestows them.
My benefactor bestows favours with more pleasure and
more complaisance too, than most people receive them
with, and this gives the relish to favour, for as Ophelia
says, ‘Gifts grow cheap when givers are unkind.’</p>

<p>“I hope the young plant thrives under your care.

<div class="sidenote">SANDLEFORD PRIORY</div>

<p>Sandleford Priory is two miles south of Newbury,
Berks. It was originally founded by Geoffry, 4th Earl of
La Perche, and his wife Matilda of Saxony, between the
years 1193 and 1202, dedicated to St. Mary and St. John
the Baptist, and placed under the Austin Canons; but
<cite>Mr. Money, in his “History of Newbury,”</cite> states “the
recluses of Sandleford” are mentioned in the Pipe Roll
of the 26th of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, 1180, so that a body of religious
had existed there or near before the date of the building<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_151">[151]</span>
by the Earl de la Perche.<a id="1_FNanchor_276" href="#1_Footnote_276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 276">[276]</a> In the reign of Edward IV.,
<i><abbr title="circa">circ.</abbr></i> 1480, a dispute arose between the Prior and the
Bishop of Salisbury, in whose diocese Sandleford lay;
in consequence of this dispute the monastery was forsaken,
and the King, at the instance of the Bishop
(Richard Beauchamp), gave it to the Dean and Chapter
of Windsor. In the 26th of Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> it was stated
to be in their possession, valued at £10.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In the time of James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, 1615, Sandleford was declared
to be a separate parish, and unratable from Newbury,
but the chapel being dismantled and unfit for use, £8 a
year was ordered to be paid to the Rector of Newbury,
which entitled the occupants of the Priory to a seat in
the Newbury parish church, which has been continued
ever since.</p>

<p>The lessees from the Dean and Canons of Windsor
appear, from a paper of my uncle, Lord Rokeby’s, to have
been, early in the eighteenth century, the Pitt Rivers of
Stratfieldsaye, by whom the lease was sold in 1717 to
William Cradock, Esq., after an intermediate alienation.
The lease was purchased in 1730 by Mr. Edward Montagu,
grandson of the 1st Earl of Sandwich. A letter of April,
1733, of Mr. John Rogers to his aunt, the <abbr title="Honourable">Hon.</abbr> Mrs.
Sarah Montagu, at Sandleford, about the death of his
mother, Mrs. Rogers, and her leaving her sister £10,
and each of her three children a ring, is in my possession,
and shows she was then living or staying with her son
Edward.</p>

<p>The chapel is erroneously stated in several works
(<i>vide</i> <cite>Tanner</cite>, etc., etc.) to be destroyed. It was disused,
not destroyed, though the bells, seats, and the tomb
of the crusading knight<a id="1_FNanchor_277" href="#1_Footnote_277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 277">[277]</a> had disappeared. As we<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_152">[152]</span>

<p>The situation of the Priory is charming, the principal
rooms fronting south on a slight eminence, sloping
to the river Alebourne, now called Enborne, which
crosses the high-road just below the lower lodge, and
skirts the south side of the park. On the east the ground
slopes to a wooded valley, down which are many ponds,
dating from the monks’ time, some of which were joined
together by Mr. Montagu, afterwards more by his widow,
to form lakes. Many fine trees surround it in these
days, and at the time of Mr. Montagu’s first living
there, seem to have been exceedingly numerous; also
walled gardens, which are now removed. Beyond the
valley to the east the ground rises in a wooded ridge.
The village here mentioned must have been a few
cottages near the mill on the west, which existed
where Sandleford Lodge is now built: these have all
long ago disappeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PARSON AND HIS WIFE</div>

<p>To the duchess Mrs. Montagu wrote in raptures of
the beauties of Sandleford, but in the middle of her
description states, “Here was I interrupted by a Parson,
his wife and daughter, and I shall not be reconciled to
‘Prunello and grogram’ again a great while, they robbed
me of those hours I could have dedicated to your grace.”
Prunello was the woollen stuff then used for clerical
gowns, grogram a coarse kind of taffety, a mixture of
silk and mohair, applicable to feminine attire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Botham writes on July 8, that as Mrs. Montagu
was unable, when her baby was born, to be applied
to, she had given him his father’s name, John. Lydia
Botham had two, if not three, daughters, but this was
her first son.</p>

<p>From Sandleford Mrs. Montagu returned to London,
intending to be inoculated, but in a letter of July 12 she
informs the duchess that Dr. Mead considered she had
better defer the operation till the heat of the summer
was over—in September. In the same letter she states
that Mrs. Medows and herself had called on the old
Countess of Granville,<a id="1_FNanchor_278" href="#1_Footnote_278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 278">[278]</a> who appears to have been a most
garrulous old lady, and Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She fell with all her violence on my complexion, and
behold, she certainly by her description takes my forehead
to be tortoishell, my cheeks to be gold, my eyes
to be onyx, and my teeth amber: all these are precious
things, but Mr. Montagu not having so rich a fancy as
King Midas, I know not whether he would like such a
wife. Your Grace may believe I was extremely mortified.
The good woman says Mrs. Medows looks better
and younger for being married; but for me I am pale
and green, and describes me as worse than the apothecary
that lives about the rendezvous of death in Caius
Marius. She is of opinion that lying in has spoiled my
face; true it is I have furnished a noble pair of chops to
the little boy, and if mine are a little the lanker for it, I
scarce grudge it....”</p>

little but outward accomplishment is regarded. Some
of our sex have an affectation of goodness, others a
contempt of it from their education; but the many good
women there are in the world are merely so from nature,
and I think it is much to the credit and honour of
untaught human nature that women are so valuable for
their merit and sense. Sure the men are very imprudent
to endeavour to make fools of those to whom they so
much trust their honour and happiness and fortune, but
it is in the nature of mankind to hazard their peace to

<div class="sidenote">THE DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH</div>

<p>The duchess, in a letter of August 26 from Bullstrode,
says, “Thanks for Sir Robert’s letter, I had never seen
it.” In alluding to the tiresome etiquette and interference
she suffered from at Welbeck under Lady Oxford’s
despotic rule, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I please myself that my children will love me
better, as my covetousness will not be obliged ’em to
pay me court, and as I shall have no suspicion of their
duty, but be convinced that their motives proceed from
disinterested love, and by that means we shall each of us
be happy. Was the Duchess of Marlborough<a id="1_FNanchor_289" href="#1_Footnote_289" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 289">[289]</a> possessed
by one good quality? I should think she deserved pity
more than the poorest creature in the street, not to have
one child, but what wishes her dead, nor capable of
knowing the enjoyments of friendship.... We propose
being in London Monday sennight.”</p>

<p><a id="1_Footnote_289" href="#1_FNanchor_289" title="Return to text.">[289]</a> Sarah, the celebrated Duchess of Marlborough.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>On Thursday, August 25, Mrs. Montagu took a
sad leave of her little boy, and started on her journey
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_158">[158]</span>to London, sleeping at Windsor, at the house of her
sister-in-law, Mrs. Medows. Mr. Montagu remained
with the child till the time his wife should be inoculated,
when he was to join her in London, and Mrs. Medows
was to take charge of him. Sarah joined her sister in
London; it will be remembered she had had the disorder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PREPARATION FOR INOCULATION</div>

<p>As inoculation is now out of date, I shall extract
from the various letters the mode of procedure. Arrived
in Dover Street, Mrs. Montagu is told by Elias, the
duchess’s porter (then a most important domestic
magnate), his mistress was coming to London on
Monday. She therefore writes to beg the duchess, the
duke, and Mr. Achard to dine with her that day “at 4
or 5 according to their convenience.” Business, however,
prevented the duchess leaving Bullstrode for a
week, but she is reinvited, as Dr. Mead says Mrs.
Montagu will not be infectious till the disease appears.
Meanwhile, in preparation for the dreaded operation,
she was “dosed, then blooded, another dose or two of
physick is all I shall want, and then proceed to meet
that distemper I have been running from these four and
twenty years: it is at present my misfortune the smallpox
is so little stirring they cannot find a subject.” She
writes to the duchess also in another letter, “Though
Dr. Mead, Dr. Cotes, Mr. Hawkins, and the subaltern of
the Physical faculty, the Apothecary, have been smallpox-hunting
this week, they have not procured a subject
for me.” She urges the duchess to dine, “as I shall be
as well till 7 or 9 days after the operation as ever I was
in my life.”</p>

<p>The duchess had been out of order with hysterical
fits, and states she was ordered to drive in a chaise. Of
this vehicle we gain a glimpse from this allusion of
Mrs. Montagu’s in answer to the duchess, “A chaise is
health, spirits and speed, a lady must lay aside her
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_159">[159]</span>hoop, her laziness and pride, before she is diminutive
enough for a chaise.” A portion of a very beautiful
letter, written by Mrs. Montagu to her husband before
he joins her, I copy—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Dover Street, Tuesday, August 30.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“The happiest moments I have spent since I
parted from you, were those I employed in reading your
letter: accept the sincerest thanks a grateful and tender
heart can make to the most kind and generous love.
While Heaven shall lend me life, I will dedicate it to
your service, and I hope our tender engagements shall
not be broke by the cruel hand of fate. Notwithstanding
the distemper I am going into, I have great hopes of
my life, and a certainty of my love to you as long as that
life shall last. Your kind behaviour and conversation
has made my Being of such value to me that I am taking
the best means to preserve and secure it from hazards,
but let not the experiment cost you an anxious thought.
It would be a reproach to the laws of Nature, if one as
virtuous as you are, should not be sure to be happy. I
trust you shall ever be so independent of a weak woman,
who can serve you in nothing but wishes: could I reflect
back the happiness I receive from you, I should tremble
at my own importance to think of sinking from happiness
to insensibility, and nothing might overcome my little
courage, but to imagine I left you a portion of sorrow
and regret as a burthen on all your years to come, would
not only afflict but even distract me.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE REV. CHRISTOPHER DONNELLAN</div>

<p>The same day that she wrote this letter to her
husband, she writes a note to Mrs. Donnellan, who
had joined her brother, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Christopher Donnellan,
at Tunbridge Wells. He, having been ordered to drink
the waters, and having crossed from Ireland for that
purpose, Mrs. Montagu says, “Does not your brother
think he is in Babel? How does he like English
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_160">[160]</span>women with French dresses and French manners? In
short, what does grave good sense think of Tunbridge?”</p>

<p>By Mr. Montagu’s desire, Dr. Sandys was added to
the previous M.D.’s. A day or two after this Mr. Montagu
joined her, and she was inoculated on September 3.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHEATEARS —<br>

<p>On September 7 Mrs. Montagu writes to Mrs.
Donnellan—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My very dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“As the time that passes between the expectation
of a matter of importance and its happening is not
a time of the greatest pleasure and tranquillity, you will
be glad to hear it is four days since I was inoculated. I
am still well and in perfect good spirits: it would be a
sign of levity as I should be sorry and ashamed to find
in myself to be disturbed at the approach of a distemper
I have been seeking. The Duchess of Portland spent
the day with me on Monday, and was here again with
Lady Wallingford yesterday, and I expect her Grace this
afternoon. In the meantime I hope to hear from you,
and my sister will give you intelligence of me. Dr.
Mead and Dr. Cotes attend me; I have given them on
their prescribing two guineas apiece, but I am told when
Dr. Mead attends constantly, one guinea a day will be
enough, if he comes only once a day, but I wish you
would be so kind as to enquire and let me know when
you write to me; and I will beg you to order your maid
to buy 2 Dozen Wheatears<a id="1_FNanchor_290" href="#1_Footnote_290" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 290">[290]</a> and send them by the Haye
Coach. Mr. Montagu never saw any, so if you please
to tell your servant to send them with the feathers on.</p>

<p>“I am extremely glad to hear Mr. Donnellan finds
benefit by the waters. Your family in Town flourishes

a perfect beauty, she has a bloom like fifteen; I never
saw anyone look so fresh and jolly.</p>

<p>“The town is full of reports of the discontent of the
Army, it is almost feared the English and H(anoverian)s
should fall upon each other. A gun going off while the
Captain was at dinner, he bade General Honeywood go
and see what was the matter; the General brought word
it was nothing, upon which the great Captain sent a
H(anoveria)n officer, who brought word it was the musket
of a soldier upon guard; the Captain then cry’d he could
have no truth from the E(nglis)h and that the E(nglis)h
had no discipline: the D(uk)e of M(arlboroug)h said
they had as much discipline as the H(anoverian)s, for

<p>“Mr. Hawkins<a id="1_FNanchor_293" href="#1_Footnote_293" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 293">[293]</a> comes every day to dress my arms,
though the wounds given for the inoculation are very
trifling, he does not think from the appearance of them
I shall be ill yet. I shall be glad when the proper
period for it arrives, but must wait with patience; it is
said people do not know themselves, but by the little

<p>To this I subjoin a portion of Mrs. Donnellan’s

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I received your comfortable letter, writ with the
spirit of a Christian, a Philosopher and a woman of true
fortitude. Since you don’t expect any appearance yet,
I may venture to write, or if you should not be quite
well, my letter is of no consequence, and may be thrown
by. I will allow all your reasoning for yourself to be
very good, and will not dispute with you now, whether
you are of consequence to the world or not, I will only
beg you to act as if you were, and take care of yourself
for the sake of the few, and let the world come in for its
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_162">[162]</span>share of you by an by. I am of opinion one guinea a
day is sufficient from a private gentle woman to any
Physician in England, if he makes but one visit. I know
all our family, and greater than us never gave more
either to Hollins or Willmot; indeed if they prescribe
twice they must be paid twice, but that I hope and
believe will not be your case. I am not acquainted with
anyone who makes use of Dr. Mead, but I suppose he is
fee’d like other Physicians of note, and I think raising
these sort of things on one another when they are already
high enough by conscience is wrong....</p>

<p>“Our company quits us apace, but as there is not
one body but Lady Sunderland<a id="1_FNanchor_294" href="#1_Footnote_294" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 294">[294]</a> and Miss Sutton and
Lady Catherine Hanmer that I care particularly for, and
they stay, I am quite easy about the matter. I generally
take a rural walk with my maid and man, and I am just
returned from the Rocks, whose natural beauties strike
me more agreeably than the laboured work of a palace.
My brother rides every day, but walking does not agree
with him.... No one here cares for a walk that carries
them further than Tod’s Room or Chenevix’s Shop.<a id="1_FNanchor_295" href="#1_Footnote_295" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 295">[295]</a> In

creatures that inhabit them.”</p>

<p>On September 12 Mrs. Montagu writes to the duchess,
who had returned to Bullstrode, to say Mr. Hawkins
did not believe, from the appearance of her arms, she
would have the smallpox. Dr. Mead and Dr. Cotes had
attended the day before, expecting to find inflammation,
but the wounds appeared healed. From this it appears
the surgeon attended the wounds daily, and doctors<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_163">[163]</span>
occasionally. The very next day (September 13) Mr.
Hawkins pronounced there was no longer a chance of
the smallpox.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu writes to the duchess, “As Anacreon
who swallowed many a hogshead of the juice of the
grape was at last killed with a little grape stone, I who
have missed the dire disease, am grumbling with the
toothache.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPE’S GROTTO</div>

<p>The duchess writes to Mrs. Montagu to beg her to
think that though the smallpox has <em>not</em> appeared, she
is as much secured as if it had. On September 15,
as a wind-up to the inoculation, Mrs. Montagu “was
blooded.”</p>

<p>“On Saturday we went to see Mr. Pope’s<a id="1_FNanchor_296" href="#1_Footnote_296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 296">[296]</a> garden
and grotto, to Hampton Court and Bushey Park,” she
writes to the duchess; and on Wednesday she was intending
to pay a visit to her parents at Mount Morris,
Kent, before returning to her child, for whom, she says,
“her heart sickens.” On October 8 she proceeded to
Sandleford, leaving Mr. Montagu, who had business, to
follow in a few days; and she writes to the duchess from
the inn at Maidenhead Bridge. In this letter she says
she has great difficulty in “squeezing the cotton in the
ink bottle which I am forced to do before each word,
and as my pen is as prodigal of ink, as the bottle is
sparing of it, after I have been half an hour replenishing
my pen, one inconsiderate blot squanders it away.”
This alludes to the strange habit of having cotton placed
in the inn inkstand, under the delusion that it made
it last longer. The whole writing of the letter is thick
and blotted. She also mentions, “My sister set out for
Bath this morning, with Mrs. Cotes. Poor madam Sally’s
stomach is greatly out of order, and her nerves are
often affected, but I hope the waters will do her good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_164">[164]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A HIGHWAYMAN</div>

<p>Mrs. Cotes was the doctor’s wife, and a sister of Lord
Irwin, a great friend of Sally’s, very small in stature and
pretty, familiarly called “the <em>little</em> Madam.” The two
ladies, accompanied by Mrs. Cotes’ footman, set out for
Bath, diverging from Newbury for a night at Sandleford
to see “Punch.” A passage from a letter of Sarah’s will
show the perils of the road. They travelled in a post-chaise—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A man set out with us from London, and kept us
company about seven miles. He often asked the footman
who we were, and whether we were going over
Hounslow Heath; to the last he made no answer, but
after being tired with his curiosity told him we were
only ladies’ maids, upon which he forsook us, either
being too proud to accompany abigails, or supposing
we had not money enough to make it worth his while
to go on to Hounslow Heath with us. We had one
post-boy that pleased us extremely, he sung all the
way, our pleasure did not arise from any music in his
voice, but from seeing him so happy, and admiring the
power of a contented spirit, that could make a person so
joyful, that was at the caprice of any one, without any
greater advantage than a shilling’s reward, and who is
always to be jolted almost to death, by the only creatures
that are beneath him.”</p>
</div>

<p>Almost shaken to pieces, they arrived at their
lodgings at Mrs. Elliot’s, in the Orange Grove, Bath.
Sarah describes the rooms as small, but comfortable,
“looking down Wade’s Passage and into the coffee-house,
which is a guard to the windows, and very
often prevents their approach.” She grumbles at the
expense of their journey, but says provisions are cheap,
fowls one shilling each.</p>

<p>Jenny, her maid, had travelled by coach, a post-chaise
of that time only holding two people. Here is a passage
worthy of Fielding, “Jenny travelled down unspotted
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_165">[165]</span>and pure with the old parson, who gave her no comfort,
but one spiritual kiss upon getting to the end of their
journey.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DANGERS OF A POST-CHAISE</div>

<p>Both Mrs. Cotes and Sarah suffered from the hardness
of the post-chaise, and Sarah also hints that other
<em>visible</em> effects had been incurred which would last for
days; hence fleas, if not worse, must have existed in it!
Mrs. Montagu, in writing to condole with them, says,
“It is a daring mind that ventures in a post-chaise.
I wonder the partizans of these vehicles do not establish
a broad bottom, and a competent share of cushion.”
The vehicle was, from what I make out, a two-wheeled
chaise. Mrs. Cotes’ footman had been directed to call,
on his way back to London, on Mrs. Montagu. The
style of speech of a servant of this period is shown in
this passage—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mrs. Cotes’ man called very civilly, and brought
me your last letter. ‘Pray, Mr. Thomas,’ says I, ‘did you
leave the ladies well?’ ‘Yes, and very merry, Madam.’
‘They had a good journey, I hope?’ ‘Yes, a very merry,
Madam.’ ‘They were not at all afraid?’ ‘No, nothing
but very merry, Madam.’ ‘Were they not tired when
they came to their inns?’ ‘No, always very merry,
Madam!’ At last Thomas’s account made me ‘so merry,
Madam,’ I was forced to retire to laugh.</p>

<p>“Your nephew gets his share of sunshine every day,
his teeth tease him and produce the dew of sorrow on
his little cheeks sometimes, but in a moment it is forgotten,
and he is always lively, and in continual health:
he is thought to grow like his mother, so I think I may
cease to be handsome with a good grace, as I have transferred
it to my offspring.... Your nephew is in his birthday
suit, laughing so I can hear him through the doors;
the usurpation and authority of those bandages called
garments he is too full of Whig principles to approve
of!”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">“PUNCH’S” CHARIOT</div>

<p>There were no babies’ carriages in those days, so
little Punch drove out daily in the <em>chariot</em>, not to be
confounded with the <em>coach</em>, a much larger vehicle.</p>

<p>In the same letter it appears that the good old Yorkshire
steward, Mr. Carter, had had a bad fall, and the
house in Dover Street not being large enough, Morris
Robinson was trying to secure them one in Bruton
Street. Mrs. Montagu, having suffered from weakness
and hysterical fits, was recommended to ride daily—a
pastime which was agreeably varied by the cutting of
new walks through the Sandleford woods, and the continual
amusement afforded to her and Mr. Montagu
by the contemplation of their child’s too precocious
ways.</p>

<p>A few details of life at Bath may prove amusing.
Sarah writes to her sister that the waters agree very
well with her, but that people are amazed at her walking
between each glass. She had found a companion in
Mrs. Wadman, Lord Windsor’s sister, whom she had
met at the pump-room, as they drank the waters about
the same time, and both were fond of walking.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> W. Freind and his wife were at Bath, and
Sarah goes to hear him preach a charity sermon,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

they would be of any use to such an extream case as
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_167">[167]</span>his.... Mrs. Potter would let her husband see nobody
but herself, and took his duty of preaching upon
herself; she tempered it with a comfortable compliance,
and when he used to say ‘I am sure I shall dye,
I wish it might be at home,’ ‘To be sure, my dear,’
answers the good wife, ‘it is proper you should dye
where you like, if you chuse it you shall go and dye at
Lambeth.’ ...”</p>

<p>At one of the balls Sarah did not dance, but she
said she did not regret it, “having no inclination to
dance with any man but Mr. Pitt,<a id="1_FNanchor_299" href="#1_Footnote_299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 299">[299]</a> and that I have not
acquaintance enough with him to expect, I can only
cherish my hopes of future good fortune.” At another
ball she dances with Mr. Vanburgh, “a very pretty sort
of man, but our affections to him are quite Platonic, as
he is in love with the youngest Miss Nash.” This must
have been the sister or daughter of Mr. Richard Nash<a id="1_FNanchor_300" href="#1_Footnote_300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 300">[300]</a>
(“Beau Nash”), the despotic Master of the Ceremonies at
Bath. He was not well at this time, and Mrs. Montagu
sends her kind regards and condolences on his health.
Amongst other people mentioned at Bath by Sarah
were the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Berkeley, Mr.
Powlett, and Mr. Bathurst, son of Lady Selina, the
two Offleys, Mr. Greville, and Lord Robert Carr, said
to be very handsome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_168">[168]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I played at Shuttlecock about half an hour, there
were five couple of us: in truth I played so much better
than any in the room, I put them all in amazement, but
it was rather owing to their bad play, and to my being
matched with the two men that played the best, than my
superior skill.... In my last I mentioned I was going
to the ball: there was a table of sweetmeats, jellies,

<div class="sidenote">“MATHEMATICAL INSTERATION!”</div>

<p>The ignorance of some ladies of this period is shown
by Sarah in the following extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A lady told us last night that Miss Molyneux is so
great a <em>Mathematician</em> that she can <em>inster</em> Greek, and that
often a dozen of the most learned men of the Kingdom
had puzzled their wise heads about a piece of Greek,
and could make nothing of it; they proposed to send
it to Miss Molyneux, and she <em>instered</em> it (<i>alias</i> construed
it), and returned them her <em>insteration</em>!”</p>
</div>

<p>Whilst Sarah was at Bath, Mrs. Montagu wrote
frequently to her mother at Mount Morris, much,
naturally enough, about her child, about whom the
fond grandmother was never tired of hearing. A little
sentence gives a clue to his looks, “If my Father has
drawn a blue-eyed simpering Cherubim, you may fancy
him not unlike your grandchild; the child’s eyelashes
are black and long, and he has a laughing look in his
eyes, blue, like my Father.” He was still toothless, and
suffered much with his gums, which made his mother
already uneasy. Mr. Montagu had just taken some
prodigious sized carp from a fish-pond at Sandleford,
and was throwing three of the old monks’ ponds, or fish
stews, into one large one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan writes from Bullstrode on October 21,<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_169">[169]</span>

trusting anything out of doors. The town of Newbury
is a melancholy example of the decay of trade,
there is misery and poverty and lawless necessity in
an unhappy abundance. We have robbing upon the
commons here very frequently: a poor labourer who
has been digging in our garden last week was very
oddly preserved from a wound by a Buckler made of
Cheese, like Sardella in ‘The Rehearsal.’ The poor
man had five shillings in his pocket, when he was
stopped by a footpad. He did not care to surrender
his wealth, and so resisted; another robber came to his
comrade’s assistance, and stuck a knife several inches
deep into some cheese and bread he had over his
bosom, in a wallet betwixt his coat and waistcoat. We
had a highwayman taken by a French dancing master
a little while ago. When the dancing master carried
him before the Justice of Peace, the Justice asked what
day of the month he was robbed? ‘Ah,’ says the
dancing master, ‘me can no tell dat,’ but turns to
the highwayman, ‘but you do know, I pray tell Monsieur,
for you must know what day you did rob, and I
pray you now be so civil as tell de gentleman,’ which, as
the highwayman denied the fact of the robbery, was as
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_171">[171]</span>good a blunder as one could desire. The highwayman

Lord Chancellor and others, still matters have since
been so far made up amongst them that it is said they
all agreed (by the mediation of Lord Orford) in the
speech and address, which is reckoned to be Lord
Carteret’s, and after a division in our House, the address
was carried by a considerable majority, the yeas being
278 against 149 noes. Mr. Pitt exerted himself against
the address with his usual eloquence and with great
acrimony against a Minister whom j need not name,

he meant was not against the Ministry, but against one

edition of <cite>Pope’s “Dunciad,”</cite><a id="1_FNanchor_308" href="#1_Footnote_308" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 308">[308]</a> to which he had just
added a fourth book:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We got <cite>Mr. Pope’s new Dunciad</cite> printed, but I
think it differs little from the old one: the new Hero<a id="1_FNanchor_309" href="#1_Footnote_309" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 309">[309]</a>
is certainly worthy to have the precedency over all
foolish Poets. I like the last Dunciad for exposing
more sorts of follies than the first did, which was
merely upon bad poets and bad criticks. I am always
glad when I see those fops who have translated their
manners and language into French foppery well ridiculed
for the absurd metamorphosis, to ridicule wrong
placed pride is of great service, for if it was not done
this land would be over-run with conceit, for here
people are proud of their vices and follies and iniquity,
and as long as Pride arises from such Stocks, we shall
never want an increase of it. Milton says, ‘<i>Nought
profits more than self-esteem right placed</i>,’ and surely
it is true of that pride that makes us disdain vice, but
that which makes people glory in it is as pernicious.
The British vice of gluttony is openly professed so
much, one can hardly dine at a fashionable table where
eating is not the discourse the whole time, and treated
of as an affair of the utmost consequence.”</p>

gentlewoman skilled in Latin, dipped in Greek and
absorbed in Hebrew, besides a modern gift of tongues.
By this learned person’s instruction was Dr. Pococke<a id="1_FNanchor_311" href="#1_Footnote_311" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 311">[311]</a>
(her son) skilled in antique lore while other people

it. His gingerbread was marked with Greek characters,

printed with Arabick, he had a mummy for his jointed

good woman, though but an indifferent Author. She
amuses herself in the country so as to be cheerful

reading, working or walking, and I don’t hear she is
pedantic.... She always carries a Greek or Hebrew
Bible to Church.... I desire your Grace to make ten

of Mademoiselle for the same, “a slight pretty thing
for a guinea.” A capucin Mrs. Robinson had ordered;
she says, “I like my capucin much better than that
which was shorter, and it is quite good enough for

a deep cape, as in a previous letter the garment is

trees safe, the next day. They have not received the
least damage, they are blooming, full of fragrance,” says

CAMBRIDGE AND STOWE</div>

<p>The following letter to the Duchess of Portland was
written from Newbold Verdon, Mr. James Montagu’s
seat in Leicestershire. He was the elder half-brother
of Mr. Montagu by Mr. Charles Montagu’s first wife,
Elizabeth Forster, daughter of Sir James William
Forster, of Bamborough Castle, Northumberland. Newbold
Verdon had been left to Mr. James Montagu by
his uncle by marriage, Nathaniel, Baron Crewe of
Stene, who married Dorothy Forster.</p>

<p class="para1">“I did not set out on my journey so soon as we
proposed; the letter we sent to my brother Montagu
having made the tour of England before it reached him,
so we waited for an answer. The 31st of July we set
out for Oxford, where we spent an agreeable day in
seeing new objects and old friends. The good people<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_189">[189]</span>
from Witney<a id="1_FNanchor_342" href="#1_Footnote_342" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 342">[342]</a> were so kind as to come over to see us,
and show us what was best worthy our attention. The
University, I think, is finer than Cambridge, but does
not excel so much as I had imagined. Alma Mater,
however, presides in great dignity there. I had hoped
to have seen Mr. Potts,<a id="1_FNanchor_343" href="#1_Footnote_343" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 343">[343]</a> but was informed he was at

<p>“The mighty Shaw<a id="1_FNanchor_344" href="#1_Footnote_344" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 344">[344]</a> had left the classic ground to
take care of his glebe in the country. The first of August
we went to Stowe,<a id="1_FNanchor_345" href="#1_Footnote_345" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 345">[345]</a> which is beyond description, it gives
the best idea of Paradise that can be; even Milton’s
images and descriptions fall short of it, and indeed a
Paradise it must be to every mind in a state of innocence.
Without the soul’s sunshine every object is dark, but a
contented mind must feel the most ‘sober certainty of
waking bliss.’ The buildings<a id="1_FNanchor_346" href="#1_Footnote_346" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 346">[346]</a> are indeed in themselves
disagreeably crowded, but being dedicated to Patriots,
Heroes, Lawgivers and Poets, men of ingenuity and
invention, they receive a dignity from the persons to
whom they are consecrated. Others that are sacred to
imaginary powers, raise pleasing enthusiasm in the
mind. What different ideas arise in a walk in Kensington
Gardens, or the Mall, where almost every face wears
impertinence, the greater part of them unknown, and
those whom we are acquainted with, only discover to us
that they are idle, foolish, vain and proud. At Stowe
you walk amidst Heroes and Deities, powers and persons
whom we have been taught to honour, who have embellished
the world with arts, or instructed it in Science,
defended their country and improved it. The Temples
that pleased me most for the design to which they
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_190">[190]</span>were consecrated, were those to ‘Ancient Virtue,’<a id="1_FNanchor_347" href="#1_Footnote_347" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 347">[347]</a> to
‘Friendship,’<a id="1_FNanchor_348" href="#1_Footnote_348" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 348">[348]</a> and to ‘Liberty.’</p>

<p>“On Saturday last we arrived at my brother
Montagu’s, who has made this place one of the most
charming and pleasant I ever saw: the gardens are
delightful, the park very beautiful, the house neat and
agreeable, and everything about it in an elegant taste.
My brother has made great improvements. It was a
very bad place when Lord Crewe left it to him, and
had no ornament but fine wood; now there is water
in great beauty, grand avenues from every point, fine
young plantations, and in short, everything that can
please the eye. But nothing gives me so much pleasure
as the obliging and friendly reception of the Master,
who has entertained us in a kind and elegant and
magnificent manner. The regularity and order of the
family, and the happiness that appears in the countenance
of every friend and servant, gives one pleasure to
observe it....</p>

<div class="sidenote">“PUNCH’S” DEATH</div>

<p>In a letter to the Duchess of Portland of August 19,
Mrs. Montagu said her boy had borne the journey
well, and was “quite well.” She intended to leave him
in Mrs. Carter’s care whilst she accompanied Mr.
Montagu to Newcastle, where the air was not healthy,
and roads very bad. Alas! a few days after, poor little
“Punch,” in cutting another tooth, was taken with
convulsion fits and died. The exact date I am unaware
of. <cite>Lodge, in his “Peerage of Irish Peers,”</cite> states
he died on August 17, and was buried at Burneston.<a id="1_FNanchor_351" href="#1_Footnote_351" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 351">[351]</a>
The date of the day is wrong, as will be perceived by
her letter to the duchess. My grandfather simply states
he died of convulsion fits, occasioned by teething, no
date; but as Mrs. Freind wrote to condole with Mrs.
Montagu on September 3, it must have happened soon
after her letter to the duchess. As no parents, from
their letters, could have adored an infant more than the
Montagus, it may be judged what a blow this was to
them. Many sweet passages about this child have I
suppressed from want of space. He seems to have been
of a too precocious nature in mind and body. He was
so large he wore shoes big enough for a child of four.
He ran alone and talked, and mimicked people’s manners
and ways, and was only one year and three months
old! “Our little cherub,” “our sweet angel,” as his
father constantly writes of him. The noble way in
which both his parents supported their anguish will be
seen by future extracts from letters. Dr. Freind’s fine
letter of condolence to Mrs. Montagu is indorsed at the<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_192">[192]</span>
back, “Letter from Dr. Freind on the unhappy loss of
my son,” and is much worn with constant reading.
He had lost two children, and was then threatened with
the loss of his father,<a id="1_FNanchor_352" href="#1_Footnote_352" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 352">[352]</a> whom he adored. The poor
Montagus, much as they desired children, never had
any more. I sometimes think that this poignant and
irrevocable loss turned Elizabeth Montagu’s thoughts
more strongly to literature and knowledge of all kind.
She sought to occupy her mind as a solace for grief,
but she never forgot her loss, and every now and then
the bitterness of it is shown in passages in her letters.</p>

your Health is good, my dependence is upon your good

assure us there is no danger of her Life, but it is terrible
to think of the pain she must undergo.”</p>
</div>

<p>The operation was performed successfully, but must
have been shocking to bear, the use of anæsthetics not
being then known. The two daughters nursed their
mother, and the affectionate Mrs. Donnellan assisted,
though herself in great trouble at the ill-health of her
stepfather, Mr. Perceval. On Christmas Day, Mrs.
Montagu writes a good report to the duchess, whose
London porter, Elias, called daily to inquire. In the
letter mention is made of “Marshall Belleisle<a id="1_FNanchor_360" href="#1_Footnote_360" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 360">[360]</a> being
taken prisoner, as he was going to the King of Prussia.

<div class="year">1745</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first letter of any interest in 1745 is from Mrs.
Robinson to Mrs. Montagu, dated May 8. In this she
alludes to the death of the second Mrs. Conyers Middleton,
<i>née</i> Miss Place, who had died on April 26, in her
thirty-eighth year. It appears the marriage had not been
a very happy one. Mrs. Robinson remarks—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Dean of Canterbury hears the Doctor (Middleton)
is going to Ireland with Lord Chesterfield.<a id="1_FNanchor_361" href="#1_Footnote_361" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 361">[361]</a>... I
take it for granted, if he goes he is to be an Irish Bishop.
It is very strange that no one can be contented with
their present state, for though the Doctor is neither
great nor rich, he has more than he wants, and can
spend his time in such studies as he chuses, and his
vacant hours in the company he has been used to, which
I think to one between 60 and 70, would be no small
consideration.”</p>

<p>“One day this week we rode to Chaucer’s Castle,<a id="1_FNanchor_362" href="#1_Footnote_362" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 362">[362]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_199">[199]</span>where you will suppose we made some verses no doubt,
and when they showed us Chaucer’s well, I desired some
Helicon, hoping thereby to write you a more poetical
letter, but the place having been, during the last Civil
War, besieged, the Muses were frightened away, and
forbade this spring to flow, so it is entirely choaked
up, and where flourished Laurels and Bays, grows only
uncouth thorns and thistles. Where erst the Muses and
the Graces played in the best room of the Castle, now
stink a few tame partridges: in short, the present owner,
having none of the divine enthusiasm of poetry, has
turned the Castle to barbarous uses. Above it is a
partridge Mew, below a court is kept for paying fines

<p>Mrs. Montagu had been far from well this spring and
summer, with lowness of spirits and nervous fainting
attacks. Dr. Mead prescribed riding as a remedy, and
finally advised her to take the waters at Tunbridge
Wells. Mr. Montagu being obliged to go to the North
about his own and Mr. Rogers’ affairs, it was agreed
that she should drink the waters whilst he was absent.</p>

<p>Lady Wallingford, who had been paying them a long
visit, set out for Bath. Mrs. Montagu left Sandleford,
August 18, for London, with Mr. Montagu, and left for
Tunbridge Wells on the 20th, Mr. Montagu leaving for
the North on August 29.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. YOUNG AND CIBBER!</div>

<p>Writing from Tunbridge Wells to the Duchess of
Portland on August 27, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have great joy in Dr. Young, whom I disturbed
in a reverie, and at first he started, then bowed, then
fell back into a surprise, then began a speech, relapsed
into his astonishment two or three times.... I told
him your Grace desired he would write longer letters,
to which he cried “Ha!” most emphatically, and I leave
you to interpret what it meant. He has made a friendship
with one person here, whom I believe you would<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_200">[200]</span>
not imagine to have been made for his bosom friend....
You would not guess that this associate of the Doctor’s
was old <em>Cibber</em>!<a id="1_FNanchor_363" href="#1_Footnote_363" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 363">[363]</a> Certainly in their religious, moral and
civil character there is no relation, but in their Dramatic
capacity there is some. But why the Reverend Divine
and serious author of the melancholy ‘<cite>Night Thoughts</cite>’
should desire to appear as a <i>persona dramatis</i> here, I
cannot imagine. The waters have raised his spirits to a
fine pitch, as your Grace will imagine when I tell you
how sublime an answer he made to a very vulgar
question. I asked him how long he staid at the Wells?
He said ‘as long as my rival staid!’ I was astonished
how one who made no pretensions to anything could
have a rival, so I asked him for an explanation: he said
he would stay as long as the <em>Sun</em> did!”</p>

very agreeable to the nature of a Philosopher. This is
a life of idleness and dissipation. I spend great part of
my day at home, but most people live upon the Publick
Walks. I have got up very early and generally read an

<p>“We lay last night at Buxton, which is a mean town,
very romantic and surrounded with barren hills, and
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_202">[202]</span>this morning, after travelling over about ten miles of
very hilly country, some of which afforded very delightful
prospects, and about 12 miles over a rich, flat
country, we came here. This town is in the general, old,
but some good houses have been built, and are daily
building. The Collegiate Church is very handsome. It
is very populous, and contains, as they say, about
70,000 people, and drives a prodigious trade.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we pursue our journey. We propose
to lye at Skipton in Craven, which if we do, we shall

Wells agreed with her, her spirits mended, and to the

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can eat more buttered roll in a morning than a
great girl at a boarding school, and more beef at dinner
than a yeoman of the Guards; I sleep well, and am
indeed in perfect health, and the waters have done me
much service.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">DR. YOUNG</div>

<p>With Dr. Young’s company she was delighted, and
she rode with him often. One ride she describes thus—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been in the vapours these two days, on
account of Dr. Young’s leaving us: he was so good as
to let me have his company very often, and we used to
ride and walk and take sweet counsel together. A few
days before he went away, he carried Mrs. Rolt<a id="1_FNanchor_373" href="#1_Footnote_373" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 373">[373]</a> and
myself to Tunbridge,<a id="1_FNanchor_374" href="#1_Footnote_374" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 374">[374]</a> five miles from hence, where we
were to see some fine ruins.... First rode the Doctor
on a tall steed, decently caparizoned in grey; next
ambled Mrs. Rolt on a hackney horse lean as the famed
Rosinante, but in shape much resembling Sancho’s ass;
then followed your humble servant on a milk white<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_203">[203]</span>
Palfrey, whose reverence for the human kind induced
him to be governed by a creature not half as strong
and I fear scarce thrice as wise as himself. The two
figures that brought up the rear, the first was my
servant valiantly armed with two uncharged pistols,
whose holsters were covered with two civil harmless
monsters, that signified the valour and courtesy of our
ancestors. The last was the Doctor’s man, whose uncombed
hair so resembled the mane of the horse he
rode on, one could not help imagining they were of
him.... On his head was a velvet cap much resembling
a black saucepan, and on his side hung a little basket.
Thus did we ride, or rather jog on to Tunbridge town.
To tell you how the dogs barked at us, the children
squalled, and the men and women stared at us, would
take too much time.... At last we arrived at the
‘King’s Head’: the loyalty of the Doctor induced him
to alight.... We took this progress to see the ruins of
an old Castle; but first our Divine would visit the
Churchyard, where we read that folks were born and
died, the natural, moral, and physical history of Mankind.
In the Churchyard grazed the Parson’s Steed,
whose back was worn bare with carrying a pillion Seat
for the comely, fat personage, this ecclesiastic’s wife.
Though the creature eat daily part of the parish, he was
most miserably lean. Tired of dead and living bones,
Mrs. Rolt and I jumped over a stile into the Parson’s
field, and from thence, allured by the sight of golden
Pippins, we made an attempt to break into the holy
man’s orchard. He came most courteously to us and
invited us to his apple-trees; to show our moderation
we each of us gathered two mellow codlings....</p>

<p>“The good parson offered to show us the inside of
his Church, but made some apology for his undress,
which was a truly canonical dishabille. He had on a
grey striped calamanco night gown, a wig that once
was white, but by the influence of an uncertain climate
turned to a pale orange, a brown hat, encompassed by a
black hatband, a band somewhat dirty that decently
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_204">[204]</span>retired under his chin, a pair of grey stockings well
mended with blue worsted, strong symbol of the conjugal
care and affection of his wife, who had mended
his hose with the very worsted she bought for her
own.... When we had seen the Church, the parson
invited us to take some refreshment, but Dr. Young
thought we had before trespassed on the good man’s
time, so desired to be excused, else we should, no doubt,
have been welcomed to the house by Madam in her
muslin pinners and sarsenet hood, who would have
given some Mead and a piece of a cake that she made in
the Whitsun holidays for her cousins.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After dinner we walked to the old Castle,<a id="1_FNanchor_375" href="#1_Footnote_375" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 375">[375]</a> which
was built by Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, in
William Rufus’ days. It has been a most magnificent
building, the situation is extremely beautiful: the Castle
made a kind of half moon down to the river, and where
the river does not defend it, it is guarded by a large
moat. The towers at the great Gate are covered with
fine venerable ivy. It was late in the evening before
we got home, but the silver Cynthia held up her lamp
in the heavens, and cast such a light on the earth, as
showed its beauties in a soft and gentle light. The
night silenced all but our Divine Doctor, who sometimes
uttered things fit to be spoken in a Season when
all Nature seems to be hushed and hearkening. I
followed gathering wisdom as I went, till I found by my
horse’s stumbling that I was in a bad road, and that the
blind was leading the blind: so I placed my servant
between the Doctor and myself, which he not perceiving,
went on in a most philosophical strain to the great
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_205">[205]</span>amazement of my poor clown of a servant, who not
being brought up to any pitch of enthusiasm, nor
making answer to any of the fine things he heard, the
Doctor wondering I was dumb, and grieving I was so

the man to trot on before.”</p>

NATIONAL TERRORS</div>

<p>This letter frightened Mrs. Montagu much. She

and despatched a messenger to London to ask advice
from a person likely to know about the affair. This
person was Mr. George Lewis Scott,<a id="1_FNanchor_377" href="#1_Footnote_377" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 377">[377]</a> eldest son of
George Scott, of Bristo in Scotland, by Marion Stewart,
daughter of Sir James Stewart, Lord Advocate of
Scotland. He was a great friend of George <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, and had
his names given to him by the Princess Sophia,<a id="1_FNanchor_378" href="#1_Footnote_378" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 378">[378]</a> who was
his godmother. He was a most able mathematician,
which formed a tie between himself and Mr. Montagu.
He was a tall, big man, very sociable and facetious,
an accomplished musician. In 1750 he was Sub-Preceptor
to George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, and in 1756 Commissioner of
Excise. I give a portion of his letter in reply; his
handwriting is beautiful—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hearing of an express said to arrive last night, I
went out in search of news, but find nothing material

infamous flight, of Saturday last. We have as yet no
authentic detail of the action. The common opinion is,
that the King’s forces both horse and foot behaved
scandalously. Inclosed I send you a list of some officers
killed and wounded in this affair. We do not yet know
what is become of the rest, excepting that the greatest
part of the Dragoons were safe at Berwick with Sir John
Cope.<a id="1_FNanchor_380" href="#1_Footnote_380" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 380">[380]</a> The Captain Stewart of the Earl of Loudoun’s
Regiment mentioned among the slain was an acquaintance
of Mr. Montagu’s, and a great friend of Mr.
Spencer’s. There are two Captains killed and regretted
of Guise’s Regiment, the same corps in which my
brother has a company. By good fortune he was not
there, being just returned from Flanders, and this Day
upon the Establishment as engineer, and ordered to<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_207">[207]</span>
attend Marshal Wade. We may once more call the
east wind a Protestant wind. Had the English and
Dutch forces, amounting to 12,000 men, been kept off by
contrary winds, God only knows what the consequences
of the loss of this, in itself trifling, skirmish might
have been. As it is the Stocks have fallen considerably.
There has been a run upon the Bank, who have
paid silver to gain time, and have been much blamed for
so doing. But on the other hand, just reasons are
alledged for their conduct. They say they had certain
knowledge that those who began the run were disaffected
persons, who, if they had been paid in gold,
might with much greater facility have transmitted
supplies to Scotland, than when paid in silver. However
this may be, it is certain that some of the most
considerable Bankers and Merchants have agreed to
support the Bank on this occasion. I am still hopeful,
notwithstanding all the bad rumours we hear, that the
old English spirit, though confessedly sunk in deep
slumbers for many years, may yet awake. Can anything
be more ridiculous and more joyful to the French, more
terrible and more shameful to ourselves, to see a Nation
which might raise 500,000 men, a nation worth twice
500 millions of property, frightened and disordered by
5000 Highland ruffians not worth £5000, if they, their

be at Nottingham. I wish the Duke<a id="1_FNanchor_381" href="#1_Footnote_381" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 381">[381]</a> were sent for to
command. He behaved incomparably well in Flanders,
avoided no danger, no fatigue, was an example of regularity

justice in rewarding merit. More troops are said to be
ordered over. This is certainly a right step, but the
consequences on the other side of the water, be what
they will.... We have a report that the Castle of
Edinburgh must soon surrender for want of provisions.
What an unpardonable neglect! If this should be so,
the consequences would be very bad, as it would furnish
the rebels with considerable quantities of cash, plate,
arms, powder, and artillery. What will happen, I know
not, but if I were Governor, I could soon fetch up provisions

<p class="para1">“Since my last letter to you by Sunday’s Post,
we had our meeting at York on Tuesday the 24th, where
there was the greatest Meeting of peoples of all Ranks
and degrees that j believe was ever known upon any
occasion. Of the nobility there was present the Lord
Carlisle,<a id="1_FNanchor_383" href="#1_Footnote_383" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 383">[383]</a> the Lord Malton,<a id="1_FNanchor_384" href="#1_Footnote_384" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 384">[384]</a> Lord Lonsdale,<a id="1_FNanchor_385" href="#1_Footnote_385" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 385">[385]</a> Lord Falconbridge,<a id="1_FNanchor_386" href="#1_Footnote_386" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 386">[386]</a>
Lord Fitzwilliam,<a id="1_FNanchor_387" href="#1_Footnote_387" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 387">[387]</a> and perhaps some others
who may have escaped my notice, together with Sir
Conyers D’Arcy,<a id="1_FNanchor_388" href="#1_Footnote_388" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 388">[388]</a> Mr. Turner, Member for the County,
Mr. Fox and Mr. Wentworth, members for the City of
York, and all the gentlemen of the County, together with
the clergy. There was the utmost unanimity and spirit
imaginable, and after a meeting at the Castle, where the
Archbishop made a handsome speech on the occasion,
an association was entered into with an address to the
King, and subscription made of near £20,000, and which
when the whole of the collection shall be made, will j
believe amount to much more. With this money there
are to be raised several Companys of foot, consisting of
50 men each, and they will be officered by gentlemen who
will serve without any pay, among whom is my friend,
Sir R. Graham, but it will be some time before these
companys can be raised, and made usefull, which would
not have been otherwise, if the Militia had been kept up
and exercised as the law directs instead of being ridiculed
and rendered contemptible these last fifty years for purposes
j need not tell you. I wish this misfortune would
for the future learn us more prudence, and make us settle
the Militia which is the only constitutional force, and
agreeable to our liberty, upon a better footing than it
has of late been, but j know too much of mankind ever
to hope to see it in this country. This rebellion has
made a most rapid and surprising progress. Edinburgh
was taken before it was believed there was almost any
such thing. The disbelief, however, of the people was
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_210">[210]</span>no excuse for the M(inistr)y, whose measures have been
the cause of it, for not crushing it at the beginning.
The conduct of our General Cope is much censured for
suffering himself to be surprised by the enemy, who in
a short time overcame, and j wish Wentworth who is
sent may have better success than he had at Carthagena.
Mr. Ridley, the Mayor of Newcastle, has taken all proper
precautions to secure the town, and if we are rightly
informed, has, with the promise of £10,000, gained all
the Keel men, who are computed at 15,000 men. The
county of Durham has raised the Militia and General
Oglethorpe<a id="1_FNanchor_389" href="#1_Footnote_389" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 389">[389]</a> is at York raising a regiment of gentlemen
volunteers. About 15,000 Dutch are j believe got to
Berwick, and j hope we shall soon have the regiments
amounting to upwards of 6000, which are lately landed in
the Thames from Holland, by means of all which force j
flatter myself a speedy end will be put to this unhappy
affair, and peace restored to our Island....</p>

<p>“I desire you will not let yourself be concerned more
than you ought at these unhappy times, nor imagine us
here in greater danger than we really are, for if the
enemy should be for coming this length, we should have
notice enough of it, and as we are at present unprovided
with force, must take to flight to save ourselves. I am
in very good health and spirits, and run no hazards but
what others as deserving and better than j do run, and
hope your good sense and greatness of mind will preserve
you from being more concerned than other people
are, or you ought to be. I desire you will add to all
the other testimonys of your love and affection to me,
what j now ask, which at all events will make me easy.
I will take all opportunities of writing to you, and am,

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_211">[211]</span>The next letter from Mr. Montagu is written from
Allerthorpe, on September 29, after having received his
wife’s earnest appeal to be allowed to join him. This
sentence shows his affection for her—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You have ever been my Pride, j have loved and
honoured you with the tenderest affection, and will
continue to do so as long as j live, but j now adore
you for the greatness of mind, joyned with the utmost
regard shewn to me in a letter which might have well
become a Roman Lady. The happiest days that j ever
past in my life, have been with you, and j hope Heaven,
after these storms shall be blown over, will grant me
the long enjoyment of your charming society, which I
prefer above everything upon Earth....</p>

<p>“I cannot consent to the danger you might run by
coming to me, however glad j might be to have you with
me, but must desire you and conjure you without any
further difficulty or hesitation to go to your Father’s in
Kent, where you will be amongst those who best love
you, and are most capable to defend you, till j can come
to you there myself....</p>

<p>“The defeat of Cope is a very great misfortune.
Everybody censures the conduct of the General, as well
as the behaviour of the soldiers. We have since the
battle heard no more but that the Rebels are encamped
at Preston Pans, near where the battle was fought.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">SUSSEX PRIVATEERS</div>

<p>On September 30, from London, George Lewis Scott
writes to Mrs. Montagu, still at Tunbridge Wells—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since my last I have seen two Officers, who were
in the engagement of Saturday sen’night, and I have had
a pretty distinct account of our dispositions, so that I
could send you a plan of that affair.... It seems agreed
both by these officers and by the General’s letter that
our men were seized with a panic at the rapid motion of
the Highlanders, so that their officers attempted to rally
them in vain. The military Chest and all the baggage
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_212">[212]</span>was taken, what the loss of men is cannot yet be known.
I find Captain Stewart is not killed, but only taken
Prisoner. Our civil panic here begins to subside a little.
General Wade’s<a id="1_FNanchor_390" href="#1_Footnote_390" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 390">[390]</a> Army will probably be near Doncaster
by this day sen’night, so that we hope Yorkshire will be
protected.... We are in no apprehensions for Berwick
or Newcastle: nor is the Castle of Edinburgh in danger
for want of provisions. Besides the ordinary Stores,
the Governor swept all the Markets in town, the day
the Rebels left it to meet General Cope. The Provost,
I hear, is in the Castle, so that I hope he will be able to
wipe off the aspersions so liberally thrown upon him.
There is no certain news of the further motions or
schemes of the Rebels. To-day I was told they intended
to march for Northumberland, and expected to be there
increased 10,000 men besides £100,000 in money. I give
no great credit to my author’s intelligence, he is of a
suspected family and speaks as he wishes. This is all
I have been able to pick up for you, and I hope your
fears begin to subside a little. But if I endeavour to
diminish them for the North I shall now on the contrary
try to increase them on the South. I mean as to your
going to Mount Morris. I saw a Sussex gentleman
yesterday, who tells me they are frequently alarmed by
Privateers on their coast, and what should hinder a few
desperadoes from landing in the night and doing as they
pleased on the coast.... I own it would give me a vast
satisfaction to see you and Miss Robinson in Dover Street
again.”</p>

Duchess of Portland on the eve of starting, she asks
her if she has</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“received a fan with Dr. Young’s picture in his riding
accoutrements. I have taken the liberty to send you

<div class="sidenote">SIR JOHN COPE</div>

<p>On October 5 George Lewis Scott wrote to Mrs.
Montagu, then at Mount Morris, a long letter, a portion
of which I copy. His handwriting, though small, was
clear and exceedingly elegant. He chaffs her and Miss
Robinson at taking refuge near the sea, and says, “If<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_214">[214]</span>
I were Captain of a Privateer, and had 50 stout fellows
to second me, I would carry you and your whole family
off in spite of the unconquered county of Kent.”...
After this he suggests</p>

<p class="noindent">“a vidette, a Sentinel on Horseback at a proper distance
from the house, who may gallop home and give you
timely allarm, your horses should be ready saddled....
The Army under Marshal Wade is not to rendezvous at
Worcester till the 12th instant. If the Highlanders have
begun their march as it is supposed, and that their Chiefs
get their men to cross the borders, (no easy task, because
of the prevailing tradition among them that none ever
get back again), they may be in Yorkshire as soon as
our Army. I am sorry that county is not better prepared,
but alas! it is not easy to be prepared in a country
rendered so artificially unwarlike as England. What
signify all the speeches of the Orators, or rather of
our ignorant, perhaps knavish babblers in Parliament
against the Army? What has been the consequence of
their insisting so often, contrary to common experience
and common sense, that our Navy was a sufficient
security. They only misled honest gentlemen. Their
frothy words will not restore tranquillity, and public
credit, nor repel the Highlanders. The Roman orators
were also warriors, even Cicero was, I believe, a better
General than most of ours, who have not forgot the Art
of War, as Miss Robinson suggests: they never <em>learnt</em> it.</p>

<p>“<i>À propos</i> of Generals, the following lines were

<p>Mr. Montagu now proposed returning from the
North, thinking matters were on a better footing, and
intended fetching his wife from Mount Morris, but
Parliament being summoned, was forced to remain in
Dover Street. Mrs. Montagu proposed joining him
from Kent on October 27. In a letter to him on the
25th, she states, “The smugglers here are all patriots
it seems, which is very fortunate, for they assemble in
formidable numbers.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson being threatened with a renewal
of cancer in her breast, was persuaded to accompany
Mrs. Montagu to London for advice. In a letter to
the Duchess of Portland at this period Mrs. Montagu
states—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The learned faculty have given us better hopes of
my Mother’s case than I could have expected. They
say it is not yet cancerous, and that it may be many
years before it hurts her. Your Grace was excessively
good in sending me the receipts which I have sent her,

jokes about Mr. Scott being in love with Sarah, but his

in the same story, they say if they had wanted to quit
their professions to be soldiers they might have had five
pounds a man to list in the Guards, or four pounds a
man to list in a marching regiment, but they chose to
list with your Grace for nothing, out of regard for you,
and to go with you and fight for you, and nobody else.
I believe one reason which made the people more
uneasy is, that at the time they were raising, it was
maliciously insinuated amongst them that your Grace’s
name was only made use of to get them to list, and that
they would be draughted and turned over to other
Colonels, which made many backward in listing, and
many of them are still apprehensive of being serv’d
so, and declare if they are, they will sooner venture
being shot for deserters than serve, and it has cost us
much pains and many good words and a great deal of
coaxing to bring them into temper; and we have told
them that in fighting in defence of their King and
country, wherever your Grace shall order them is the
true way of serving your Grace, and that they may be
assured they will not be draughted and turned over to
other Colonels, and they seem now to be pretty easy
for the present, and I believe, will march chearfully
and willingly enough, when and wherever your Grace
shall please to order them. Give me leave, my dear
Lord Duke, once more to offer myself and fifty men,
quite volunteers, to bear our own expenses, to wait
on your Grace, if you must expose your person to
danger, wherever you shall please to command us, and
cloath ourselves in what manner you like best, and<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_218">[218]</span>
shall think ourselves happy in hazarding our lives for
the preservation of yours, who are so dear a Father to
your Country.</p>

stay any longer for Mr. Squire’s answer. I dare venture

<p>A letter of Mrs. Montagu’s to the Duchess of Portland,

<div class="sidenote">CATTLE MURRAIN</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Carlisle is surrendered to the rebels, who, I hear,
behave civilly, and not as conquerors.... Ligonier is
still ill; the Dukes of Richmond and Bedford are set
out. Lord Sandwich is aide-de-camp to the Duke of
Richmond. I pity poor Lady Sandwich, she endeavours
to bear up, but certainly she is in an uneasy situation;
I saw her on Sunday, and she is to dine here to-morrow....
I suppose you know Sir Francis Dashwood

at Medmenham Abbey. Mention is made in this letter

milk. A passage in a letter of November 26 to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sarah Robinson, writing from Mount Morris, states
that they were in great fear of an invasion of the French.
It filled her with unspeakable terror, as well as the
servants; but she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My Father, you are to understand, is not at all concerned,
he is not at all afraid of an invasion, nor don’t
think there is the least probability of it, but for all that
he has ordered everything to be packed up that can be
packed.” She adds, “I don’t know that the French will
invade us, but I am sure crossness has, and my Father
is just miserably out of sorts, so it’s a pity but he should
stay in the house, he would presently scold the French
away.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">INVASION EXPECTED —<br>
THE LAW REGIMENT</div>

<p>The Montagus had now left London for Sandleford,
and Mr. George L. Scott writes the following letter to
Mr. Montagu:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“London, December 12, 1745.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I did not expect so sudden an occasion of
writing to you. You need not, however, expect very
important news, it being only to inform you that henceforward
you may shine in the dignity of F.R.S., you
were elected this evening, and may be admitted when<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_220">[220]</span>
you return to town. We had a very hot alarm this
morning, of a descent of the French in Sussex. It was
grounded upon a letter of a gentleman of distinction in
your county; the Secretary of the Customs roused Mr.
Pelham with the news at three, but a more certain and
contradictory account came by eight, with us the report
subsisted till two, and then vanished. Thus far, they
say, may be depended on, that Dunkirk Harbour is filled
with Ships. If the French can get a footing in Kent, it
will be their fault if they do not do us inconceivable
damages by destroying our docks, and raising heavy
contributions. Were it not for some individuals, and
innocent persons who would suffer on such an occasion,
I should not grieve in the least to see some others pay
the penalty of their infatuation or dastardly spirit. I
only wish the King’s forces might be strong enough to
take the booty from the French, and divide it among
themselves; this would be no loss to the nation, and
only transfer property from the fools or cowards to
the brave. I say the same of the Northern counties,
through which the Rebels have passed. They have
behaved infamously. Sullivan, who was in Corsica
with Marshal Maillebois,<a id="1_FNanchor_400" href="#1_Footnote_400" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 400">[400]</a> has now felt the difference
between modern Englishmen and Corsicans, much
to the honour of the latter. These poor people, undisciplined
and unarmed, almost with any thing but
the spirit of liberty, baffled two veteran armies. Here
a country more extensive than Corsica, better peopled,
richer, and either well armed, or such as might have
been so if they pleased, and with-all well furnished
with plenty of horses, has tamely suffered itself to
be overrun by a pack of foot banditti, two-thirds of
which, by the best accounts, are scarce men, <i lang="la">pudet hæc
opprobria</i>!</p>

<p>“Our accounts from Scotland are but melancholy.
The Rebels lay what contributions they please. Some
Clans, they say, have taken arms, not with any intention<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_221">[221]</span>
to assist either side, but only to plunder. It is now at
last agreed upon to bring over the Hessians. What a
shame that we should want them! and what a shame
that since any man might see we did want them, they
were not brought over sooner. I say the same of the
remainder of our country. Our administration puts me
in mind of the rustic mentioned by Demosthenes, who
coming into a fencing school, never foresaw a blow, but
as soon as he was pushed, he would then clap his hand
to the place, and so shift it after another blow, being
thus always too late.</p>

<p>“Our law regiment received his Majesty’s thanks
much about the time you left this on Tuesday, with an
intimation that the rebels being retired, he was unwilling
to put us to any further trouble or expense. The
frustrating this scheme is placed to the account of the
mean jealousy of a certain great man. His family, I
hear, on the other hand complain that he should be
reproached on this head, when he was totally ignorant
of the whole affair, and his being at all mentioned in it,
was entirely owing to the indiscretion and impertinent
zeal of some silly young fellows, who might fancy to
obtain his favour by their conduct on this occasion, but
what he totally disapproves of. What the truth of the
matter is I know not, but I have my own suspicions,
which possibly I may find an opportunity to verify. If
they prove true, all I can say is I would not have some
men’s souls for their estates.</p>

finds the country answer her expectations, as to health
and every other respect.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fears of a French invasion increased
in the southern counties, as will be seen by this letter
of Mrs. Robinson’s to Mrs. Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“December 15, 1745.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“Before you receive this you will have heard
from Sally that she this day sett forward for Cantʸ, in
order to proceed for London to-morrow morning: indeed
the frequent alarms we have had for this last week
has been too much for her spirits, and I pressed her to
go, for she was not able to make herself easy in staying,
and yet, poor girl, she went with great heaviness, though
she had a mind to it, and Mr. Robinson, though he
thought the fright more than necessary, was very easy
with it. Yesterday he had a certain account from Dover
that Admiral Vernon sent yᵐ an express last Tuesday,
yt he had reason to believe yt ye French design’d landing
a great force (it was said 200,000, though yt, I think,
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_223">[223]</span>must be a mistake) at Dover, or on the Kentish coast,
and ordered them to keep themselves in readiness to
oppose them: 400 men keep watch at nights, and ye
inhabitants keep all their best effects packed up to send
away at ye first approach of danger. These things
much magnified, and told in many different shapes, are
sufficient to alarm most people that live where we do,
for should any army land on ye coast of Kent, I am told
Romney<a id="1_FNanchor_404" href="#1_Footnote_404" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 404">[404]</a> is the most convenient place, as there is a
fine flat to land on, and no opposition can be made, as
we are destitute of forces, and the people entirely unarmed
and frightened out of their wits: we are in the
worst situation of any gentleman’s house in the county
in such a case, for they must pass within two or three
fields<a id="1_FNanchor_405" href="#1_Footnote_405" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 405">[405]</a> of ye house, if not through the yard, and you
know we stand very visible, yt in such case, which God
forbid, we must be great sufferers, they wou’d certainly
spoil what they cou’d not carry away, and probably set
fire to the house. But as to our selves, I don’t doubt
but we are as safe as the rest of the Nation, for we have
given orders for an express to come away if any landing
appears in ye Marsh, and should set out in an hour’s
time, whereas an army would be some days in landing.
Nor am I in any fright, no do I believe they dare attempt
any such thing, but that ye transports that lay manᵉᵈ at
Dunkirk are designed to land some forces in Scotland,
of wcʰ two was taken, and broᵗ into Deal yesterday,
bound for Montrose, and I think Suffolk would be a
better place yⁿ ye Kentish coast, and less guarded: but
I will tell you what I have done by way of precaution.
I have packed up all ye lining, plate and Clothes yt
cou’d be spared from constant use, and all writings,
and they are ready loaded in the waggon, and secured
tennants’ horses to carry them off. As to furniture, it
may take its fate, as I cou’d neither put it up properly,
nor get carriages to carry it off on ye sudden, and it
wou’d be great expence, and great damage to do it to no<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_224">[224]</span>
purpose. Pray don’t be in any fright for us, for you
may be sure we shall take care of ourselves so far as
not to be caught, and that is all anybody can do. I shall
be greatly concern’d shou’d such a thing happen, for our
own misfortune and those of everybody’s else, for ye
whole nation must be sufferers, though some may feel
it in a more particular manner than others, as they wou’d
be more in ye way of these people. I am much at ease
yt Sally is gone, as a sudden alarm might have affected
her so as to have highten’d my fright, wʰ wou’d have
been more for her than for myself. There is orders
come to ye Deputy Lieutenants to raise ye Militia, we
hear yt the Dutch Ships with Admiral Vernon sail’d this
afternoon northwards, by which we hope ye fears of this
part grow less, or he wou’d not lessen his forces.</p>

as are necessary in a message. He told a lady of quality
who inquired after my health, that I was <em>pure stout</em>, and
if I am in good spirits he tells people I am <em>brave</em>, that
he is likely to establish me as a character of violence....
If your youth can carry a message, keep himself sober
and clean, and stay at home, when he is not sent abroad,
they are all the qualifications I desire. He is to have
livery, and frock every year, and six pounds wages the

<p>Greater threatenings than ever of an invasion arose

<p>In the same letter she comments on the prevailing
expectation that the Pretender would arrive at some

<p>At the end of April, or commencement of May, Mrs.

following one, undated, in reply for a letter of condolence
of Mrs. Freind’s:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“The tender hand of a friend does all in the
power of human art to heal the wounds given by affliction.
That you love me, and interest yourself for me,
must on all occasions give me comfort. It is not consistent
with duty or prudence to be ever considering
one’s loss with those circumstances of tenderness that
make one unable to bear up against it, so I will say as
little as possible of the dear, tender parent, and endeavour
to recollect her only as a most excellent woman,
and try to become good by her example. She concluded
with an heroic constancy the most virtuous life. From
her prosperity she drew arguments of resignation and
patience, and expressed the greatest thankfulness that
Providence had lent her so many blessings without<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_228">[228]</span>
repining that they were to be taken away. How few
are they that do not grow proud and stubborn by that
indulgence which made her humble and resigned! She
had spent her life in doing those just, right things that
bring peace at the last; and after living so many years
in the world, left it with the greatest innocence of soul
and integrity of heart I ever knew. How much superior
is this to the forced and immeritorious innocence of a
sequestered Cloister; for after having bent to all the
duties of human life, she had not contracted any of the
vices or bad affections of it; nor had she the least tincture
of the secret faults of malice or envy which often
lurk about the hearts of those who are esteemed persons
of unblameable conduct. Through every action of her
life she deserved to be loved and esteemed, and in her

loss of my dear Aunt, and how deeply I share in your<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_229">[229]</span>
affliction, could afford you any relief, I should endeavour
to lay open a most sorrowful Heart to you, tho’ I could
send you but a faint copy of it, for my grief, like yours,
is at present too big for utterance. I can offer nothing
for your consolation, but what I’m sure your own
thoughts will have suggested to you; that the Dear,
the Valuable Parent you have lost has lived to enjoy
the Greatest Blessing a parent can have, the seeing her
children brought up in health and prosperity; that she
who acted so strictly up to her duty in every capacity
here is only removed from the Happiness she reap’d in
her Family, to receive the further and infinitely greater
Reward of her well-doing; that since the Giver of Life
saw fit to finish hers by so painful a Distemper, it is
some comfort that her Misery was of no longer
duration.</p>

<p>“From these considerations I am persuaded you will
find all the consolation that such an affliction can admit
of. Your letter is dated the 5th, but it did not reach
me till the last post, and had the Dublin postmark on it.
I had received the melancholy news from Lady Suffolk,
but could not write to you immediately upon your misfortune.
The news of my poor Aunt’s Death is a heavy
addition to such a load of sorrow as I was before nearly
ready to sink under. My eldest girl has lately discovered
some tendency to my asthmatical Disorder;
the Thought that she received this from me, and that
the rest of my dear Babes stand the same unhappy
chance, is such an affliction to me....</p>

<p>At this period Lord Andover presented the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>

with a constant succession of company, whilst their
father, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Lumley, was alive. Reduced to
poverty by his death, they both married men of small
fortune, therefore one is not surprised that Lydia
Botham, unaccustomed to small means, and, in spite of
her delicacy, extremely fond of society, soon incurred
debt and embarrassment with a growing family and
small income.</p>

<p>Lady Andover, who was her constant and best friend,
writes on June 26 to Mrs. Montagu to explain the excessive
melancholy of Lydia, who was proceeding that week
to Albury. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The blame they lay upon themselves for having
lived beyond their circumstances and the sense of
having injured their children, of whom they are most
tender, is a reflection sufficient to bring a person of
Lydia’s sense and goodness to the dejected state she is

Lydia also is so blind to all his defects that the least
disrespectful thought of Johnny would make her more

them, for there, as they unfortunately began with entering
into all the expenses that attend a great neighbourhood,

<div class="sidenote">THE “LITTLE PÈRE”</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu was much distressed by the poor boy
employed in her garden at Sandleford having accidentally
fallen into a pond there and been drowned,
an account of which she writes to the duchess on
August 7. In this letter she begs the duchess to
send the “Little Père,” as he was fondly called (Dr.
Courayer), to stay with her, from Bullstrode, where
he had been domiciled some time. At the same time
she asks for two peacocks, “After asking for Dr.
Courayer to beg your two peacocks, are there in
Nature things that differ like this Philosopher and the
bird of noise, vanity, and ostentation?” The peacocks
were to console a white pea-hen at Sandleford for the
loss of her mate, a white peacock, which, together
with a quantity of poultry, had been stolen by the
bargemen of Newbury. The Montagus sent a party
of armed servants to inspect the barges, but only
feathers and eggs were discovered. The peacocks were
duly conveyed by waggon to the “Windmill,” Slough,
whence the Newbury waggoner, Sandy, conveyed
them to Sandleford. The duchess, in writing about
them, adds, “Lord Cromartie is pardoned; the King
sent for my Lady to acquaint him with it. Was
not that doing it in the most tender, compassionate
manner?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan was at this time at Tunbridge, at
Lord Percival’s house, and Mrs. Montagu jokingly confided
her father, Mr. Robinson, who was there, to her
care. On August 5 Mrs. Donnellan writes to say of
Mr. Robinson, “I can assure you he is in very good
widower’s spirits.” She adds, “He has lent me his
chariot daily to carry me home at night to Lord
Percival’s.” Mrs. Donnellan waited at Tunbridge till
the death of her friend, Sir Robert Sutton,<a id="1_FNanchor_412" href="#1_Footnote_412" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 412">[412]</a> which was<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_233">[233]</span>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF MR. CARTER</div>

<p>Mrs. Botham, having an alarming attack of asthma
which caused her six sleepless nights, Mrs. Montagu
writes to recommend her Valerian tea, made from the
roots. Evidently “Lydia” was not a notable housekeeper,
as she also instructs her in the art of keeping a
weekly account book, and entering in it every item of
expense. The duchess was anxious for the Montagus
to go to Bullstrode, but the visit was deferred, as the
three younger Robinsons were spending their holidays
at Sandleford, and the captain and Morris Robinson
expected Mr. and Mrs. Freind there as well. Poor old
Mr. Carter, the steward, was just dead of fever, which,
it was thought, he caught when on agent’s work at
Newcastle, where fever had been rife amongst the unhappy
prisoners of the ’45 confined there. He was
a great loss to Mr. Montagu, who was contemplating
a journey north to place his affairs in young Mr. Edward
Carter’s<a id="1_FNanchor_414" href="#1_Footnote_414" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 414">[414]</a> hands. Dr. Conyers Middleton, in a letter
from Bath, of September 21, proposes setting out at
Michaelmas “with young Frederick” for Sandleford for
a few days. Mr. Montagu, accompanied by Mr. Carter,
had set out on their northern journey, staying at
Newbold Verdon with Mr. James Montagu <i>en route</i>,
arriving at Theakstone by October 7.</p>

<div class="sidenote">YOUNG EDWARD WORTLEY MONTAGU</div>

<p>Two curious letters to Mr. Montagu from his
eccentric young cousin, Edward Wortley Montagu,
occur next. He was the only son of Mr. Montagu’s
first cousin, Edward Wortley Montagu, whose father,
Sidney Montagu, was the second son of the great
Earl of Sandwich. Sidney Montagu married Anne,
daughter and heiress of Sir Francis Wortley, and
assumed the name of Wortley. By her he had one
son, Edward Wortley Montagu, who married Lady
Mary Pierpoint, daughter of Evelyn, Duke of Kingston;
they had two children, Edward, born in 1713, and Mary,
born 1718, who married John, Earl of Bute. To give
young Wortley Montagu’s eccentric life here would
take too much space, but the reader will find an epitome
of it at the end of this work. In 1745, he was in
the Army through the influence of his relation, the
Duke of Montagu, had been through the campaign, and
was present at the Battle of Fontenoy. He became a
prisoner of war, but was shortly before the date of
the first letter exchanged, and, coming to England, was<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_238">[238]</span>
given, by the Earl of Chesterfield,<a id="1_FNanchor_424" href="#1_Footnote_424" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 424">[424]</a> a commission to

case he was waylaid and robbed. Mr. Montagu had
always acted a kind part towards his young cousin,
and frequently interceded for him with his father, old
Wortley Montagu, in his endless escapades, which were
enough to try any parent’s heart.</p>

he heard a despatch was to be sent. He alludes to his
father having visited Lord Chesterfield to ask about
him, as they were not on speaking terms then, though
his father was at the same time anxious he should
enter Parliament. The second letter is from Ter Goes,
May 15, 1747 (N.S.)—</p>

<p>“We sailed from Harwich with the wind contrary,
and were two pacquets in company. We were attacked
by a privateer of 16 guns and got clear of him after a
combat of between four and five hours. As soon as I
arrived at Helvoet, I went immediately to the Hague,
staid one day there, and then went on to H.R.H.<a id="1_FNanchor_426" href="#1_Footnote_426" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 426">[426]</a> with a
pacquet from Lord Sandwich; the moment the Duke
saw me he told me I was released, and ordered me to
take post and join my regiment. The moment I got to
the regiment, I found it retreating from the French,
having lost between two and three hundred men and
about 10 officers killed or wounded; our Major is among
the former. When we got to the seaside we did not<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_239">[239]</span>
find vessels enough to embark us all, so our regiment,
as the eldest, embarked the last, but when all Braggs’
and most of the Highlanders were got off, we and the
remainder of them were attacked by a body of 1200.
They were so well received that they quitted us, after
having lost three officers and about twenty-seven men.
We lost only one officer and a very few men. Billanders
came just then, and we got off very luckily, for had
we staid ten minutes longer we should all have been
killed or taken, for we were scarce on board when we
saw a considerable body march to the ground we had
been on....”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Writing to the duchess on July 6, Mrs. Montagu
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A few days ago I carried Mrs. Donnellan and the
little Père to see Mr. Sloper’s gardens<a id="1_FNanchor_432" href="#1_Footnote_432" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 432">[432]</a> and house at a
time when I was assured he was absent on his election,
but seeing a man ride up the avenue at the same time, I
took it into my head it might be Mr. Sloper, so I did
not alight immediately. The housekeeper came to me
and asked if I would walk in; I said I should be glad to
see the house if Mr. Cibber was not at home; the
housekeeper looked aghast, as if she had spoilt a custard
or broke a jelly glass; I coloured, Mrs. Donnellan
tittered, Dr. Courayer sputtered, half French, half
English, and began to search for the case of a spying
glass I had dropt in my fright. As my organs of speech
rather than of sight, seemed defective, I was little
interested for my perspective, but sat in the coach
making melancholy reflections on my mistake. Mrs.
Donnellan could not compose her countenance, so that
we were near a quarter of an hour before we got out of
the coach; and after so long a pause I walked into the
house, greatly abashed.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>To understand this joke it must be explained that
Mrs. Theophilus Cibber,<a id="1_FNanchor_433" href="#1_Footnote_433" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 433">[433]</a> the celebrated actress, was
the mistress of Mr. Sloper. She had been forced into
marriage with Theophilus Cibber,<a id="1_FNanchor_434" href="#1_Footnote_434" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 434">[434]</a> son of “old Cibber,”
the celebrated actor, and her husband, who was a worthless
man, had connived at the connection. In a previous<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_243">[243]</span>
letter of Mrs. Montagu’s, of 1744, mention is made of
a house at West Woodhay furnished by Mr. Sloper for
Mrs. Cibber “entirely in white satin.” A further
passage says—</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. COURAYER</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I believe I could shake your spleen with a description
of Dr. Courayer’s figure—when he arrived here
from Oxford through a whole day’s rain; but let it
suffice that he shone with drops of water like the
Diamond ficoides. How his beaver was slouched, his
coloured handkerchief twisted, and his small boots
stuck to his small legs; how the rain had uncurled his
wig, the spleen dejected his countenance, the cramp
spoiled his gait! not being much accustomed to riding
he was so fatigued and benumbed he could scarce walk,
that for so good a Christian he appeared surprizingly
like Un Diable boiteux. Mrs. Donnellan and I could
not help laughing; with the vivacity of his nation, he
fell in with the mirth and helped on the raillery his
figure provoked.”</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu was detained in London by much legal
business. He tells his wife her father, Mr. Robinson,
carries him to Ranelagh. She retorts, “I am very glad

he would not make you a coquette, a character I think
him a little inclined for.”</p>

<p>The next letter, July 23, to Mr. Montagu, from young
Edward Wortley Montagu, who had been returned
Knight of the Shire of Huntingdon, described an
election ball. “Our ball last Monday was very brilliant.
We had a very elegant supper for near 200 people, and
finished by dancing till 6 in the morning.” He mentions
“my friend untieing his purse strings with the greatest
reluctance, and was very peevish to see so many people
at Supper, which he thinks very unwholesome.” This<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_244">[244]</span>
is probably old Wortley, his father. A christening of
one of Lady Sandwich’s children had just taken place.
Mrs. Montagu was godmother by proxy. “I assure
you I wished the real Godmothers had been there
instead of the substitutes.” Then stating Lord Sandwich
had left so hastily they did not know if he had
arranged for venison for the races, he begs Mr. Montagu
to ask the Duke of Montagu to send him two bucks,
“to be here by Tuesday.”</p>

<p>The Duchess of Portland, writing on July 24, mentions
“Lady Bute is with me; she is a most agreeable
friend in all respects.” This was Edward Wortley
Montagu’s only sister, Mary, who was born in 1718,
whilst her father was ambassador to the Porte. She had

<p>“Yesterday we went to see a very extraordinary
place. A gentleman has built a house on the summit
of a prodigious hill, where there is not a drop of water
nor a stick of wood; he has planted some fir trees
which are watered every day by carts that bring the
water about three miles; he has sunk a well to the
centre of the earth, from whence some laborious horses
draw him as much water as may wash his face, or in a
liberal hour supply his tea kettle. The winds plays
about his house in so riotous a manner, that a person
must poise themselves in a very exact manner to maintain
their ground and walk on two legs with an erect
countenance as it is the glory and pride of human nature
to do.... The first house this gentleman built was in
a bottom, where the ground was all wet and marshy,
overgrown with willows and alders and extremely
peopled with frogs; there he found himself ill at ease,<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_245">[245]</span>
and no doubt but in time would have died of a dropsy,
as I now fear he will be destroyed by a wind cholick.</p>

<p>“A few days ago we were at Miss Lisle’s wood and
grotto; the work of 9 sisters, who in disposition as well
as number, bear some resemblance to the Muses. On

THE AXLETREE</div>

<p>In the next letter of August 23 is the description of
Lady Fane’s grotto—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The situation is, like most grottoes, placed where a
grotto would not be looked for: it joins to the house.
Now having told its only defect, I will go on to the rest.
The first room is fitted up entirely with shells, the sides
and ceiling in beautiful mosaic, a rich cornice of flowers
in baskets and cornucopias, and the little yellow sea
snail is so disposed in shades as to resemble knots of
ribbon which seem to tye up some of the bunches of
flowers. There is a bed for the Hermit, which is composed
of rich shells, and so shaded that the curtain
seems folded and flowing.... The room adjoining it is
the true and proper style for a grotto; it is composed of
rough rock work in a very bold taste, the water falls
down it into a cold bath. This grotto is about 50 yards
from the Thames, to which the descent is very precipitate.
From the Shell Room you have no advantage of
the Thames, from the other room you have a view of it.
The House to which this grotto is joined is a small
habitation where Lady Fane used to pass a good deal
of time. Lord Fane’s seat<a id="1_FNanchor_437" href="#1_Footnote_437" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 437">[437]</a> is about a mile from it: it
has not indeed the view of the Thames, but is finely
situated in a bower of Beech Wood, and before it a<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_246">[246]</span>
pretty prospect. From the Grotto we went to a Wood
by the Thames, where we sat and eat our cold dinner
very comfortably. In the afternoon we walked up a
hill which commands a fine prospect, the Thames winds
about in the manner it does at Cliefden. There is a
want of wood, as I think the country rather flat, but
the prospect is very extensive; you see Oxford and
Reading, one on the right, the other on the left hand.
In our road thither one of the wheels took fire and
burnt thro’ the axletree.... A wheelwright was apply’d
to but he had been carousing at a christening, and was
not in that degree of sober sense requisite to make even
an axletree. A Justice of the peace whom the King had
knighted lived hard by; to him we applyed for a coach,
as it was part of his office to send vagrants to the place
of their abode. Alas! his coach, which contrary to
other things used to rest on the week days and work
only on the Sabbath, had not been licensed, to the great
inconvenience of his lady and the grief of Carter John,
who one day in the week was a coachman.... What
was to be done? The sun was declining, we were 20
miles from home.... A good inn with the sign of the
Blue Boar, Green Dragon, or Red Lion would have
pleased us better than all we had seen, but—Alas! the
only village within reach offered us a homely lodging
under thatched roofs. We were a party of seven, and
might have stormed the village with more ease than the
French can Bergen-op-Zoom, but the plunder w’d not
have given us a supper, or the place afforded us a
lodging. But on finding the uncoached Justice was
married to Sir Robert Sutton’s niece,<a id="1_FNanchor_438" href="#1_Footnote_438" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 438">[438]</a> an acquaintance
of Mrs. Donnellan’s, she sent her compliments, told our
distress, and we were kindly received that night. The
wheelwright slept himself sober, the next day made
us an axletree, and we came home laughing at our
adventures.”</p>

Several of the Saxon Kings have their bones collected
into a sort of Trunk.... William Rufus is interred
there too, in a kind of stone chest; William of Wickham
and Cardinal Beaufort bear their ensigns of the
Prelatick order on their tombs, which are very handsome;

gardens are pretty, and there is a fine lawn before the

sight of the river at Southampton, where we arrived
pretty late in the evening. The next morning we surveyed

most pleased me there, was the prospect from a little
Round Tower from which one has the finest view
imaginable, the sea and river most encompass it....

His Lordship had great reason to be content, for tho’

with great expence, the native graces of Mount Bevis
surprize and charm the beholder, and have an effect that

Wight; we dined on our cold loaf in the room where
King Charles was prisoner; it is a neat, strong castle
but small—Harry Bellardine is governor of it. Another
day we were carried to Beaulieu, a seat of the Duke of
Montagu’s, the wood and water make it the finest summer
situation imaginable. The house was part of an
old Abbey,<a id="1_FNanchor_443" href="#1_Footnote_443" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 443">[443]</a> and there are traces of the Monastery that
show it was large. We saw a fine prospect of the
River and Isle of Wight from a place called Exbury.
From Lyndhurst we went to Salisbury; on the Sunday<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_249">[249]</span>
we went to the Cathedral and heard an excellent sermon
from the Bishop of Lincoln. We received great civilities
from the Bishop of Salisbury<a id="1_FNanchor_444" href="#1_Footnote_444" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 444">[444]</a> and Mrs. Sherlock. I
cannot describe Wilton,<a id="1_FNanchor_445" href="#1_Footnote_445" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 445">[445]</a> it exceeds all that poetry and
painting can represent. A fine lawn leads you to a
charming river, on which there is a bridge, and such a
bridge!<a id="1_FNanchor_446" href="#1_Footnote_446" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 446">[446]</a>... What sort of Bridge, say you? Why
such a bridge as the gods would build to lead the souls
of the Blessed from Lethe to Elysium if Charon would
permit it. This leads to a fine hill covered with Nature’s
verdant carpet adorned with fine plantations.... We
descended from this hill and crossed the river again
over another elegant building, and so returned to the
house. The apartments are very noble, the Statues and
busts are famous.... The rooms are very fine, and
there is one which exceeds any I ever saw and which
has in it the fine family piece by Vandyck; it really
exceeded my expectation, the figures are so finely
painted, their attitudes are gestures and their looks are
speech; there are many other fine pictures. From
Salisbury we directed our course to Stone Henge,
which is an astonishing thing.... Thence we went
to Amesbury,<a id="1_FNanchor_447" href="#1_Footnote_447" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 447">[447]</a> where great improvements are making.
There is a little river which winds about so as to make
the place appear almost an island. There are three
pretty Bridges, one in the manner of a Chinese house.
The Duke of Queensborough has planted the hill very
prettily. The house was a hunting box, built by Inigo
Jones, the front handsome, the inside very small, only
one fine room.</p>

<p>“We got that night to Marlborough, early enough to
walk in Lord Hertford’s garden.... Lord Hertford
has made a pretty grotto.</p>

<p>“From Marlborough we took our route to Lord<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_250">[250]</span>
Bruce’s,<a id="1_FNanchor_448" href="#1_Footnote_448" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 448">[448]</a> the access to it is very noble, avenues planted
or woods cut thro’ for a mile and a half before you reach
the house. The house contains a great number of fine
rooms richly gilt and adorned with handsome chimney
pieces; there are many family pictures and some very
good ones....</p>

<div class="sidenote">MATTHEW ROBINSON’S ELECTION</div>

<p>Matthew Robinson had been returned member for
Canterbury with little opposition. In writing to her
father to press his visiting at Sandleford, Mrs. Montagu
begs him to leave his canvasses, but bring his
painting materials. “We will provide all possible conveniences
for your work, and you may create immortal
plants, clouds that will never dissolve in rain, nor be
chased by wind, and suns that shine larger than in the
miraculous days of Joshua.” She also thanks him for
<cite>Hoyle’s book on Chess</cite>, and <cite>Taylor’s on Perspective</cite>,
and some drop medicine called “Devil’s Drops,” which
Mrs. Montagu alludes to as having “a quality that
makes one less fit for conversation than the Vapours
themselves!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_253">[253]</span></p>

<p>Matthew Robinson writes from Trinity Hall, Cambridge,
to his father as to his young brothers William
and John. William was at St. John’s, and John at
Trinity Hall. Both matriculated most creditably.
William<a id="1_FNanchor_450" href="#1_Footnote_450" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 450">[450]</a> was said to be the best scholar of the year
of his college, and John’s tutor had a high opinion of

<div class="sidenote">LORD LYTTELTON’S “MONODY”</div>

<p>Parliament being summoned for November 10, Mr.
Montagu set out, but very unwillingly, as his wife had
been suffering much from “spasms of the stomach,”
a complaint she was much plagued with. In a letter
of November 14 he promises to send a pamphlet on
Lord Lovat’s trial, and Mr. Lyttelton’s verses. This
latter was the celebrated <cite>Monody</cite> which he wrote
after the death of his first wife, <i>née</i> Lucy Fortescue,
who had died on January 19 of this year, leaving
him with two children—Thomas, afterwards 2nd Baron
Lyttelton, and Lucy, who married Arthur, Viscount
Valentia.</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu, accompanied by his neighbour, Mr.
Herbert, of Highclere, inspected his new house in Hill
Street, which was then being ornamented, and with
which he was not pleased. They then proceeded to see
Lord Chesterfield’s house, which was nearing completion.
He says “his principal apartment, which is
on the ground floor, will be very magnificent.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan writes on November 17—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I went with Mrs. Southwell<a id="1_FNanchor_451" href="#1_Footnote_451" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 451">[451]</a> on Saturday to <cite><i>King
Lear</i></cite> to see Garrick and Mrs. Cibber, both performed
extremely well. I think he took the part of the old testy
madman better than the Hero, and Mrs. Cibber is the
soft, tender Cordelia in perfection. I am only provoked<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_254">[254]</span>
that they have altered Shakespear’s plain, sincere, artless
creation into a whining, love-sick maid. I would
have an Act of Parliament, at least of Council, that
nobody should add a word to Shakespear, for it makes
sad patchwork....</p>

gave me comfortable words, said mine was a Bath case,
would be cured by the waters, but medicines were
improper and dangerous, and neither ordered bolus,
draughts, or electuary, or any of the warlike stores of
the faculty. The waters do not disagree with me, nor
have I been ill since I came in any violent degree. My

He was a young man so promising in his profession

“We have lost the man in England for a point of law.”
His treatise<a id="1_FNanchor_454" href="#1_Footnote_454" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 454">[454]</a> on Gavelkind still continues to be the
standard book on that subject. In sprightliness of wit
and fertility of invention he much resembled his sister.
He left on Mrs. Montagu’s recollection “an indelible
impression of admiration, and a regret which no subsequent
acquisition in friendship could sufficiently
compensate.”</p>

the regimen agreed with her, and she accompanied
Mr. Montagu to Sandleford on May 1, leaving Sarah
Robinson, who was suffering from headache, with her
friend, Miss Grinfield, at Bath. From this period dates
the extreme intimacy which grew up between Miss
Robinson and Lady Barbara Montagu, sister of George

<p>From the Middletons, Mrs. Montagu writes to Mrs.
Donnellan—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Cambridge, June 15.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“As I date my letter from the modern capital
of the Muses, you will perhaps expect that I should
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_257">[257]</span>send you some strains of immortal poetry, but I have
not yet met with any such thing, and must rather give
an account of the Buildings than the literary works of
the University. I had some pleasure in the recollection
of the easy careless years of infancy, some part of which
I passed here with the most tender of relations, a fond
grandmother; in comparison of whose indulgence all
other indulgence is severity, as you must be sensible if
ever you had the greatest of infant comforts, a grandmother.
So much to my particular circumstances; then,
to the general situation of the University. The Colleges
do not in general, stand so as to give ornament to the
town, as those of Oxford, but if the town is the worse
for it, the Colleges are the better, as they open to the
fields, and from thence receive and give a fine prospect.
King’s College, Clare Hall, and Trinity Library, and
the finest of Gothick buildings—King’s College Chapel,
makes a beautiful appearance from the public walks.
Trinity College is a most noble thing; the Quadrangle
is a sixth part bigger than that of Christchurch in
Oxford. The Library is very handsome, and esteemed
one of the finest rooms in the World. In the Library
there is preserved the skeleton of a gentleman who left
his bones as a monument of his regard to mankind on
purpose to instruct even the most superficial observer
of the formation of the human body, and at the same
time designed that his name, like his body, might be
snatched from the grave; how various are the roads to
Fame! Some seek them by grand and pompous obsequies;
others expect them for not having Christian burial,
and hope to be remembered by a magnificent tomb, or
the want of a coffin. I always thought vanity the very
marrow of a human creature, and it sticks to them even
to their very bones.... What gives me the greatest
pleasure is the seeing Dr. Middleton married to a
person<a id="1_FNanchor_460" href="#1_Footnote_460" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 460">[460]</a> who seems formed to make him happy; she is
very well bred and agreeable, has a most obliging temper,

her playing on the Harpsichord in great perfection.</p>

This sentence shows that Mrs. Donnellan was a friend of
Mr. Samuel Richardson, the great author: “I wish you
much pleasure with the nightingales at North End, and
you have a good right to be of so harmonious a society.”
North End, near Fulham, was Mr. Richardson’s<a id="1_FNanchor_461" href="#1_Footnote_461" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 461">[461]</a> country
house. He had published “<cite>Pamela</cite>” in 1740, and “<cite>Clarissa
Harlowe</cite>,” which was to make such a lasting sensation,
was published in this spring of 1748.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEACE OF AIX-LA-CHAPELLE</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu writes to her sister, who was still at
Bath on June 25, from Hill Street, where, as she states,
everything is in great confusion, “the middle floors not
laid.” Mrs. Dettemere, her lady’s-maid, had just lost her
husband, whom she had not seen for years, but loved
dearly. She appears to have been a poor lady, but the
cause of her living separate from her husband does not
appear. Dr. Shaw had been consulted as to a return
of Mrs. Montagu’s spasms of the stomach, and recommended
the extraordinary remedy of “sweating.” This
was to remain in bed for days and weeks in flannel
sheets, which at midsummer could have hardly been
endured. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He assures me I shall neither be sick or nervous: after
my sweating fit is over, I am to drink asses’ milk, ride on
horseback, and grow fat and jolly. I am now thinner
than ever, so the reformation will be greater if I
grow fat.... My brother Robinson had a very pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_259">[259]</span>
journey to Aix, where I daresay he will have a great
deal of pleasure. There will be a great concourse of
people of all nations, and Lord and Lady Sandwich are
extremely obliging to him....</p>

<p>“Mr. Flower sent your jumps<a id="1_FNanchor_462" href="#1_Footnote_462" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 462">[462]</a> yesterday; I did not
pay for them on account of his raising the price.”</p>

<p>The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had been signed in
March, Lord Sandwich and Sir Thomas Robinson<a id="1_FNanchor_463" href="#1_Footnote_463" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 463">[463]</a> being
the English plenipotentiaries. Lady Sandwich, going out
to join her husband, persuaded Mr. Matthew Robinson,
who was a great friend, to escort her to Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="1_Footnote_463" href="#1_FNanchor_463" title="Return to text.">[463]</a> “Short Sir Thomas Robinson,” called in contradistinction to
“Long” Sir T. Robinson, Mrs. Montagu’s cousin.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In order to while away the weary hours of lying in
bed at Sandleford, Miss Anstey and Dettemere had to
read aloud to Mrs. Montagu <cite>Admiral Anson’s book, “A
Voyage round the World</cite>,” recently published. Sarah
Robinson designated it “as the best receipt book in
England as far as dressing turtles and some Indian
animals can reach.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan had lost her stepfather, Mr. Percival,
on April 26 of this year. He had long been in declining
health. She was very anxious about the remedy Mrs.
Montagu was taking, and demanded constant news. She
recommends <cite>Townsend’s “Translation of the Conquest
of Mexico”</cite> to be read to Mrs. Montagu. Her mother,
she writes, had taken a house for the summer months
“a little beyond the walls of Kensington gardens, and
I have a key to the nearest door.”</p>

<p>Dr. Shaw is mentioned as going away on his travels,
leaving no directions for his patients, and the Duchess
of Portland as giving him £600 to enable him to travel
and find her shells and curiosities, for which she had
an insatiable appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_260">[260]</span></p>

<p>Sarah Robinson continued at Bath with Lady Bab
Montagu, and hints are thrown out in some of the letters
of an attachment springing up between her and Mr. G.
L. Scott, mentioned before. Captain Pigott, an admirer
of Sarah’s, is described as “dressed according to custom
in a tied wig fresh powdered, a bloom colour cloth coat,
laced most magnificently with gold, and bloom-coloured
stockings; he visits our door continually, but all the
consequence is a little expense in chair hire to him.”</p>

<p>Two people with immense trains of attendants are
noticed as then at Bath, the Earl of Harrington<a id="1_FNanchor_464" href="#1_Footnote_464" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 464">[464]</a> and
Earl of Hertford,<a id="1_FNanchor_465" href="#1_Footnote_465" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 465">[465]</a> the latter “never stirs without three

<div class="sidenote">SPA</div>

<p>Three letters of Matthew Robinson to his sister from
the Continent whilst with Lord and Lady Sandwich
contain a few interesting paragraphs—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After my last letter we set out for Spa, whither
we travelled through the Dutchy of Limburg, a most
beautiful country to look at, and among the rest we
saw to the left the Forest of Arden where Jacques
moralized, but though it is about 80 miles in circumference,
by means of bad government and its revenues
being carried to its Princess, the Empress, to Vienna
its capital, Limburg is a pitiful village and in the whole
Dutchy there are not above 4 or 5 other villages, still
more contemptible. At Spa we lived a very merry life,
and were entertained by an Hungarian Prince and other
German nobility. Tokay and other very good wines
gave us a taste how very fine a country Hungary must
be, but our scheme was unluckily cut short in the
middle by Lord Sandwich having a sudden call to Aix.
Upon our return Sir Thomas Robinson was here, who
at his Lordship’s request is joined with him as second
plenipotentiary; he says he is an old familiar of my<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_261">[261]</span>
Father’s, and inquires much after him. Our life here is
as it used to be. The Sunday before last there was a
most magnificent gala, a dinner, supper and ball at the
French ambassador’s on account of St. Louis’ day, where
I assure you I was much charm’d with the unaffected
liveliness and gaiety of the French.... Last Sunday
we had a second part of the same comedy by the Dutch
on account of the Prince of Orange’s birthday; besides
a dinner and supper, there was a ball at the Maison de
Ville, which of itself is very magnificent, and was finely
decorated by Mr. Vanharen. Lady Sandwich both in
her journey and here has often wished for your company....
To-morrow morning I set out for Bonn upon
the Rhine, and we go from thence all down the Rhine to
the Hague.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE HAGUE</div>

<p>Matthew and a Mr. Gee left Lord and Lady Sandwich
at Aix. Young Edward Wortley Montagu was
acting-secretary to Lord Sandwich. From the Hague he
writes in October—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since I wrote to you last I have taken a long and
pleasant journey up the Rhine among the palaces of the
four Electors, from thence I am come to the Hague,
about 10 days ago. From the neatness of the town,
the incomparable walks and rides about it, its rendezvous
of Ministers and politicks, it is a very agreeable
place to live in. The Ministers here by turns hold
assemblies of the men at their houses, morning and
evening, and I have dined at the house of one or other
of them almost every day. The court is well filled and
well attended, but as formal as our own.... The most
extraordinary person here is Mr. Grounen, the Father
of Mrs. Trevor, wife of our envoy, who has knowledge
and sense enough to be mighty well acquainted with the
History of Europe, and to be supposed by some people
to be writing the History of his own times, to have constantly
every noon about him a resort of the Ministers
and best company here, to be the center of all their<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_262">[262]</span>
news, and to be the particular and intimate acquaintance
of several great men, and among the rest the correspondent
of Lord Chesterfield, and yet at the same time to
be so mad as for fear of infection literally not to touch
any human creature, neither his servants, his children,
nor even his second wife!”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF MR. JAMES MONTAGU</div>

<p>Mr. James Montagu, half-brother to Mr. Edward
Montagu, had for some time been deaf, and was now
in a very dropsical state; he now fell very ill. Mr. and
Mrs. Montagu nursed him tenderly till the end, which
took place on October 30. From letters of Mrs. Medows
to Mrs. Montagu one learns the brothers had not been
brought up together; hence the blow was less acutely
felt. He appears to have died in London. His estate
of Newbold Verdon in Leicestershire was left to Wortley
Montagu. Mrs. Medows says, “I can’t help feeling
a little hurt that Newbold goes where it should not,
but I really believe Sandleford is a pleasanter place to
live in.”</p>

<p>In a letter to Sarah, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Montagu is now returned from the melancholy
ceremony of opening the will. My brother has left us
a handsome legacy, and also all his plate and jewels,
which last, he told the person who made the codicil,
would be proper for me, as I had refused any when I
married, perhaps his brother would forget them. I
hear the plate is valued at £1500, and the jewels, they
say, are fine, but I never saw them. I esteem the good
will and kindness of the donor more than ever I shall
the glittering gems.”</p>
</div>

<p>The two sailor brothers had just returned from the
East Indies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Charles grown from a fine boy to a very clever
man, he is improved in all respects.... My house
looks like an Indian warehouse: I have got so many<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_263">[263]</span>
figures, jars, etc., etc., you would laugh at the collection,
my gown I brought out of the ship buckled under my
jumps, it is very pretty and the work extremely neat.
The Captain has brought China, Lutestrings, taffeties
and Paduasoys, they wear so well, but the colors are
not as good as those of our manufacture.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">PRICE OF TEA</div>

<p>Tea was also brought, and Dr. Conyers Middleton
had 4 lbs. at 16<i>s.</i> a pound. He had just brought out his
“<cite>Free Enquiry into the Miraculous Powers</cite>.” Matthew
Robinson writes of it on December 17, “Middleton
will tell you there is no belief to be given to any of the
miracles related by the Fathers, Hume<a id="1_FNanchor_466" href="#1_Footnote_466" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 466">[466]</a> says that there
is no belief to be given to miracles related by any man
whatsoever.” And thus end the letters of 1748.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am ashamed that I have been so remiss in writing
to my dear sister, but business and amusements have
poured in torrents upon me. I was some days preparing
for the subscription masquerade, where I was
to appear in the character of the Queen Mother,<a id="1_FNanchor_468" href="#1_Footnote_468" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 468">[468]</a> my
dress white satin, fine new point for tuckers, kerchief

diamonds on the head, and my hair curled after the
Vandyke picture. Mrs. Trevor<a id="1_FNanchor_469" href="#1_Footnote_469" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 469">[469]</a> and the Lady Stanhopes’<a id="1_FNanchor_470" href="#1_Footnote_470" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 470">[470]</a>
adjusted my dress, so that I was one day in my
life well dressed.</p>

<p>“Miss Charlotte Fane was Rubens’ wife, and looked
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_265">[265]</span>extremely well; we went together. Miss Chudleigh’s<a id="1_FNanchor_471" href="#1_Footnote_471" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 471">[471]</a>
dress or rather undress was remarkable. She was Iphigenia
for the sacrifice, but so naked, the High Priest
might easily inspect the entrails of the victim. The
Maids of Honour, not of maids the strictest, were so
offended they would not speak to her.</p>

of a chanoiness. Many ladies looked handsome, and
others rich, there was as great a quantity of Diamonds
as the town could produce. Mrs. Chandler was a starry
night, the Duchess of Portland had no jewels, and was
miserably dressed. Lord Sandwich made a fine Hussar.
Mr. Montagu has made me lay by my dress to be painted
in when I see Mr. Hoare again. His picture is thought
like, but the face too full for my thin jaws. I staid till
5 o’clock in the morning at the masquerade, and was not

<p>Mrs. Montagu paid a visit to the Bothams at Albury
soon after this. From the letters it appears Mr. Matthew
Robinson was pressing a suit on Miss Godschall, a rich
heiress living near Albury, but it came to nothing.</p>

<p>In June, Mrs. Montagu, being recommended to drink
the Tunbridge waters, was accompanied by Lady
Sandwich, who was also ordered there; Mr. Montagu
remaining on business for a while in London, Sarah<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_266">[266]</span>

<p>A letter from Lady Talbot welcoming them to stay
with her till they found a house now appears. She
was the wife of William, 2nd Baron Talbot, afterwards
Earl Talbot and Baron Dinevor, <i>née</i> Mary de
Cardonnel, a great heiress, who had been married at the
age of fifteen! An amiable, affectionate person, and a
great friend of Mrs. Montagu’s. Mrs. Montagu writes
for her chariot to be sent to her; she and Lady Sandwich
having performed the journey in Lady Sandwich’s
post-chaise,<a id="1_FNanchor_475" href="#1_Footnote_475" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 475">[475]</a> then a new vehicle.</p>

<p>They stayed three weeks drinking the waters,
during which Lady Talbot had a bad fall from her
horse. A report reaching Tunbridge Wells that Lord
Sandwich had a fever, his wife, accompanied by Mrs.
Montagu, drove in four hours to London, where they
found him recovered by the taking of bark. As Lady
Sandwich wished to be present at the Huntingdon races,
she did not return to Tunbridge, but Mrs. Montagu
persuaded her sister-in-law, Mrs. Medows, to accompany
her there for a week. Mr. Montagu now joined her
from Sandleford, whither he had been accompanied by
Captain Robert Robinson, the sailor brother. The
captain proceeded on to Bath to see Sarah. Before
leaving town, Mr. Montagu had been much distressed
at the illness of his relative, the Duke of Montagu, and
sent daily to inquire after him. He had only been at
Tunbridge a few days before the duke died, and he was
summoned to town as an executor, together with the
Dukes of Bedford and Devonshire. Mrs. Montagu
writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am grieved at the heart for the poor Duke
of Montagu, as he was your friend and the friend of<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_267">[267]</span>

him, he is embalmed in the tears of the poor and the

unloved.”</p>

<p>This is the Duke of Montagu<a id="1_FNanchor_476" href="#1_Footnote_476" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 476">[476]</a> mentioned by Horace
Walpole, page 141 of his letters to George Montagu, “as

<div class="sidenote">MRS. VESEY</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu got £100 as executor. Whilst he was
detained in London, Mrs. Montagu made an expedition
to Coombe Bank in company of Mr. and Mrs. Vesey.
This is the first mention of people who were destined
to become most intimate friends. Mrs. Vesey was the
daughter of Sir Thomas Vesey, Bishop of Ossory. She
married, first, Mr. William Handcock; secondly, her
cousin, Agmondesham Vesey, of Lucan, Ireland. He
was M.P. for Harris Town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FEATHER SCREEN</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I went yesterday along with Mrs. Vesey to see
General Campbell’s place; we set out to avoid heat a
little after 6. Lady Allen lent us her coach and six.
We got to Coombe Banke by nine. It is about 16 miles<a id="1_FNanchor_478" href="#1_Footnote_478" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 478">[478]</a>
from here. We walked about the gardens, which are
very pretty, and saw the house, dined under the shade,
and about 4 o’clock Mr. and Mrs. Vesey got into their<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_268">[268]</span>
post-chaise to go to London. I mounted my horse and
went to Senoak, where Lady Allen’s coach waited for
me. Lord Sandwich and Lord Anson were just come
to the inn, and going to dine on turtle, to which they
invited me, but I had made a more agreeable meal in
General Campbell’s garden.... I am going to dinner
to Lady Talbot’s, where I breakfasted. Lord Sandwich
and Lord and Lady Anson and a great deal of company
are to dine there. We have now such a crowd we
expect a splendid ball to-night. I received great civility
from Mr. and Mrs. Vesey, and they desired to know how
I got home last night, so I must beg you to send the
enclosed note to them in Bolton Row. They desired
leave to see the house and celebrated feather screen, so
I have wrote to Betty to have the house in order, and
to set the screen for them.... Coombank is but a small
place, but a fine terrace commands a beautiful view of
the country. The house is most elegantly furnished.
We were offered everything as politely as if the General
had been there. We had a fine dessert of fruit served
in the finest china. Our dinner we carried, but wine,
tea and coffee were offered us.”</p>

<p>This feather screen was in six panels, one of which
was worked by Miss Anstey, in imitation of one of the
Duchess of Portland’s. The feather work, immortalized
afterwards by the poet Cowper, had been begun, but it
was the Duchess of Portland’s original idea. Numerous
letters mention feathers being sent or asked for. Lydia
Botham collected the plumage of peacocks, pheasants,
and jays. Every known sort of parrot and macaw was
placed under contribution. From Albury the boxes of
feathers were sent by the Guildford coach to the “White
Horse cellar in Piccadilly.” With these came fifty pens
made by Lydia from her geese.</p>

his wife had gone to stay with Lady Sandwich for a
grand ball at Huntingdon, and the election of a new
mayor. He says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am not surprised that Hinchinbrook pleases
you so well, or that you are of opinion it is capable
of being made a fine place, it stands upon an eminence
and commands a fine prospect, which those that made
the Terrass well knew. The venerable old elms in the
road are very ornamental, and the wood at the bottom
of the garden is pretty as is also the plantation in the
Park. The brook from whence the place takes its name
is at a due distance from the house, and might be
improved into a river or fine piece of water. I doubt
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_270">[270]</span>not my Lord will do it, if not at present, at an age more
suitable. The room where Oliver Cromwell was born
I daresay Mr. Audley will be proud to show you, and is

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lady Sandwich was so good as to spend a week
with us, and as the weather was fine for this time of
year, we went out in the post-chaise all the morning,
then dinner, tea and supper pretty well filled the rest of
the time. On Monday I went with her Ladyship to
Reading, where we lay that night. The next morning
she went to town, and I returned hither, where I found
my brothers, who give me a very agreeable account of
your health ... I saw our friend Cotes the day before
I left town, she is very well and in good spirits, and
seems determined to keep her freedom and enter no
more into wedlock’s bonds. She has only a small
lodging, and I think with her economy she might afford
herself a house of her own, and she might furnish it in
the present fashion, of some cheap paper and ornaments
of Chelsea China or the manufacture of Bow, which
makes a room look neat and finished. They are not so
sumptuous as mighty Pagodas of China or nodding
Mandarins. My dressing room in London is like the
Temple of some Indian god: if I was remarkably short
and had a great head, I should be afraid people would
think I meant myself Divine Honours, but I can so little
pretend to the embonpoint of a Josse, it is impossible to
suspect me of such presumption. The very curtains
are Chinese pictures on gauze, and the chairs the Indian
fan sticks with cushions of Japan satin painted: as
to the beauty of colouring, it is carried as high as
possible, but the toilette you were so good as to paint is
the only thing where nature triumphs. Lady Sandwich
brought her sons here, they are charming boys; Lord
Hinchinbrooke<a id="1_FNanchor_483" href="#1_Footnote_483" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 483">[483]</a> is much improved since you saw him,

of application will make her useful to herself and other
people. I was afraid she would never have been either

she should be buried in Westminster Abbey near the

<div class="sidenote">LORD PEMBROKE’S DEATH</div>

<p>A letter occurs now from the Duchess Dowager of
Chandos, third wife, and widow since 1744, of the 1st
Duke of Chandos, surnamed the “Princely Duke,” the
builder of the palatial residence of Canons, in Middlesex,
on which he spent £200,000. Having spent his fortune
in building and speculating, Canons was sold for the
<em>material</em> at his death. The duchess’s maiden name was
Van Hatten, but she had been married to a Sir Thomas
Davall. After the duke’s death she came to reside at
Shaw House,<a id="1_FNanchor_487" href="#1_Footnote_487" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 487">[487]</a> near Newbury, from whence she writes
to Mrs. Montagu, and after some inquiries as to health,
etc., says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What different tempers the world consists of: I am
told passion sent the late Lord Pembroke<a id="1_FNanchor_488" href="#1_Footnote_488" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 488">[488]</a> out of the
world, but that Mr. Middleton who opened him says
that both heart and all the vitals were displaced by
the continual swathing he used to keep himself from
growing bulky. This was itself a discontented temper,
and if at any time I should be extremely strait laced
and contradicted, it is certain my crossness would have
been very great, and I or my lace must burst. The
giving Ward’s pill to a cock and then turning it into broth
for old Lady Northampton<a id="1_FNanchor_489" href="#1_Footnote_489" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 489">[489]</a> has something curious in it
too, but as it ended in death, I suppose will not be
practised further. How many tricks do we try to
lengthen life, and yet like poor Lord Pembroke waste it
in tormenting our blood because others will not be of our
mind, or we are too fat, or too lean to please ourselves:
if there is not another life where we may be more perfect,
<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_274">[274]</span>more happy, we are certainly the most inconsistent,

<div class="sidenote">THE EARTHQUAKE</div>

<p>The earthquake mentioned by Horace Walpole in
his letters to Sir Horace Mann, page 349 in volume 2,
on February 5, created much terror. The Montagus
were in Hill Street at the time. On February 20, in a
letter to her sister, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was not under any apprehensions about the earthquake,
but went that night to the Oratorio, then quietly
to bed, but the madness of the multitude was prodigious,
near 50 of the people I had sent to, to play at cards here
the Saturday following, went out of town to avoid being
swallowed, and I believe they made a third part of the
number I asked, so that you may imagine how universal
the fright must be. The Wednesday night the Oratorio
was very empty, though it was the most favourite performance
of Handel’s.”</p>
</div>

<p>A slighter shock took place a month later; some
people prognosticated a worse shock on April 3, which
was to swallow up London. The following letter of the
Duchess of Chandos alludes to this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Shaw, April 3.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I do assure you although I had many accounts
of the earthquake, I do easily perceive the difference
betwixt a fright, and a sensible account of the same
matter of fact: the day this, I hope, will kiss your hands
and find perfect peace and safety at Hill Street, is the
day when in many people have great fears, but in my
opinion without reason, for I never heard of periodical
earthquakes, and the coolness of the weather I hope will
assuage these sulphurous heats. It would now bear
hard upon Human understanding as well as gratitude,
if when they see how very easily the destruction of
popular places may be effected, we should not all live in<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_275">[275]</span>
such a way as to make Death not so extremely shocking
to us, as it has appeared to some of the gay world at
this time. The same Providence that certainly made
this complicated and beautiful Machine, is not the
children that blow bubbles in air only to divert themselves,
but has will, and good further designs suitable to
His infinite goodness and wisdom, and therefore a hope
in Him is a real security in all evils, and as to the manner
of Death I have it, may be a peculiar thought, that there
is a degree of pain that human nature cannot exceed
consistent with life; which is a great mercy, or else our
cruelty to one another would be without bounds: therefore
I will never be too anxious what is the manner of
my death, but trust it to that power that sent me into
life....</p>

which from the knowledge he had of him, he hoped he
would make no scruple to do, upon which the Professor
told him he thought he could live but a few hours; then
he asked the Professor if from his pulse he thought his
death would be easy, who answered that he did. He
further told the Professor he had taken Dr. Heberden’s<a id="1_FNanchor_492" href="#1_Footnote_492" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 492">[492]</a>

<p>On October 16 she writes, “The cruel owner of the
house near Mr. West makes unreasonable demands, we
are going to treat for one about two miles from him,
which Mrs. West and he went with me to see yesterday.”
She laments it is so far from the Wests. This house
was at Hayes in Kent, or, as it is frequently spelt in the
letters, “Heyes.” Mrs. Montagu continues—</p>

<p>In a letter to Sarah at this period, Mrs. Montagu
mentioned the appointment of her brother Robert to a
Madras and China voyage: “I rejoice in the Captain’s
appointed voyage to Madras and China, it is reckoned a
profitable and healthful voyage, and all we ask for our
King is ‘in health and wealth long to live.’” She then

<div class="sidenote">THE DOWAGER DUCHESS OF CHANDOS</div>

<p>Probably the Duchess of Portland may have been
one, as she sided with Sarah in the affair, telling Mrs.
Montagu that she might wish to obey her in all other
respects, but could not control her affections. Lord
Bolingbroke is said to have recommended him through
Lord Bathurst. The ill-starred marriage took place
probably at the commencement of 1751, but no letters<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_281">[281]</span>
are left recording it. On November 18 the Dowager
Duchess of Chandos died at Shaw House, near Newbury,
and in a letter to Miss Anstey is thus noticed—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A little before I went to London I lost my very
good neighbour, the Duchess of Chandos, a stroke of
the palsy carried her off in a few days: her bodily pains
were great, but her mind felt the serenity that gilds the
evening of a virtuous life. She quitted the world with
that decent fare-well which people take of it, who rather
consider it as a place in which they are to impart good
than to enjoy it. Her character has made a great impression
on me, as I think her a rare instance that age
could not make conceited and stiff, nor retirement discontented,
nor virtue inflexible and severe.”</p>
</div>

<p>To Mrs. Donnellan, on December 30, Mrs. Montagu
says, “The Duchess of Chandos is greatly missed by
the poor this rigorous season.”</p>

<p>In these two letters the following books and
pamphlets are recommended, “<cite>An Occasional Letter</cite>,”
said to be Lord Bolingbroke’s;<a id="1_FNanchor_505" href="#1_Footnote_505" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 505">[505]</a> the King of Prussia’s

<div class="year">1751</div>

<p>January, 1751, finds Mrs. Montagu in London, and
Mr. Montagu at Sandleford Priory, engaged in business
affairs. Mrs. Montagu, on January 7, writes to him—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I am glad you are so far tired of your monastic
life as to think of returning to the secular state of a
husband and a member of Parliament. I believe our
predecessors in the cowl had their particular kinds of
<i>volupté</i> which silence, secresy and peace might much
enhance and recommend; but to those who have been<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_282">[282]</span>
used to the bustle and business of life such pleasures
want vivacity. Boileau makes a man who goes to visit
the Chantre just before dinner observe the luxury of a
prebendal table. Says he—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Admire le bel ordre, et reconnait l’<em>Eglise</em>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I have sat so constantly in Lady Sandwich’s chimney
corner, I can give you little account of the world.”</p>
</div>

<p>To which Mr. Montagu rejoins, “I am much obliged
to you for the kind impatience you show at my stay
here; in a few days I now hope to convince you that
however unworthy of either state, I have deserted
neither.” He was accompanied to London by Captain
Robinson.</p>

<p>From a letter of Mr. Gilbert West’s of May 16, 1751,
we learn that Mrs. Montagu, though wishing to be
near London and yet not in it, did not take up her
temporary residence at Hayes till then. In it he says,
“I have agreed with a farmer at Wickham to fetch your
goods at the price of 15 shillings: the waggon will be
in Hill Street to-morrow morning early.” He desires
her to breakfast and dine at West Wickham with him,
and signs himself, “Dear Madam, your loving cousin to
command till death, G. W.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE COUSINHOOD”</div>

<p>In the collection of letters published by her nephew,
Matthew Robinson, 4th Baron Rokeby, he says he
cannot remember the reason why West and Mrs. Montagu
called each other cousins, but he had forgotten his
cousinship to the Bothams, the beloved cousins of his
aunt, Mrs. Montagu. “The cousinhood” was also the
favourite term of the whole set of Wests, Pitts, and
Lytteltons, all much connected in marriage and extreme
intimacy.</p>

<p>Gilbert West was at this period forty-five years of<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_283">[283]</span>
age only, but even then a perfect martyr to gout.
Amongst his poems and translations was <cite>Lucian’s
“Triumph of the Gout,”</cite> every line of which he could
painfully indorse. In his <cite>“Lives of the Poets” Dr.
Johnson</cite><a id="1_FNanchor_506" href="#1_Footnote_506" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 506">[506]</a> brackets him with Crashaw under “the two
venerable names of <em>Poet and Saint</em>.” He was often
visited by Lyttelton and Pitt, “who, when they were
weary of faction and debates, used at Wickham to
find books and quiet, a decent table and literary conversation.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="1_Footnote_506" href="#1_FNanchor_506" title="Return to text.">[506]</a> <i>Vide</i> <cite>Johnson’s “Lives of the Poets.”</cite></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>There may still be seen at Wickham a walk made
by Pitt, and at Wickham, Lyttelton received that
conviction which produced his “Dissertation on Saint
Paul.” The same spirit of <em>cheerful</em> and <em>benign religion</em>
was now to exercise a large influence on Elizabeth
Montagu, to strengthen her already religious turn of
mind, and to enable her in the future, though living in
the great world of fashion and rank, and the idol of
society, to keep that sacred, secret lamp of spirituality
<em>not of this world</em> alight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WEST FAMILY</div>

<p>The family circle at the Wests was a happy one; his
wife and sister adored him, and he was the magnet that
attracted all to him. He had a great sense of humour
and a pretty taste for decorating, as the many letters
upon the subject of the adornment of the Hill Street
rooms show; Mrs. Montagu took his advice in every
point from this time till his death in 1756. At the period
I am now writing of he was far from well off, though
expecting promotion, with just reason, having been a
faithful servant to the King, and secretary to Lord Townshend
during his period of office as Secretary of State.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. R. BERANGER</div>

<p>Amongst the friends of the Wests, Mrs. Montagu
now made acquaintance with Mr. R. Berenger,<a id="1_FNanchor_507" href="#1_Footnote_507" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 507">[507]</a> called<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_284">[284]</span>
by Mrs. West “the little Marquis.” He was the son of
Moses Beranger and Penelope Temple, and was therefore
related on the maternal side to West. He afterwards
became “Gentleman of the Horse” to George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>
He wrote a book called the “<cite>History and Art of Horsemanship</cite>.”
He was famous for his charm in social life.
Hannah More called him “everybody’s favourite, all
chivalry, blank verse and anecdote,” and Dr. Johnson
dubbed him “the Standard of true Elegance.” He was
a great friend of the Garricks. Another fresh acquaintance
was William Henry Lyttelton, brother of Sir
George (afterwards Lord) Westcote.</p>

<p><a id="1_Footnote_507" href="#1_FNanchor_507" title="Return to text.">[507]</a> R. Berenger, born 1720, died 1782.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>At some early period of this year Sarah Robinson
became the wife of George Lewis Scott, but no date
is recorded, and no letters concerning the marriage
remain. Only on June 9, when Mrs. Montagu was
making her yearly visit to Tunbridge Wells in company
with Lady Romney, she writes to her husband at
Sandleford to say she had arrived safely, “Mrs. Scott
and the Captain,” whose departure to China had been
delayed, seeing her off. From other letters it appears
the Scotts, accompanied by Lady Barbara Montagu,
took up their abode in Leicester Fields, now Leicester
Square, doubtless to be close to Leicester House, where,
with their mother, the widowed Princess of Wales,<a id="1_FNanchor_508" href="#1_Footnote_508" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 508">[508]</a>
Scott’s royal pupils dwelt.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>At Tunbridge Mrs. Montagu joined Mr. and Mrs.
West and their son, and lodged in the same house. At
Tunbridge were Sir George Lyttelton, his brother the
Dean, the famous Mr. Garrick, the Bishop of London, etc.
Then she wrote—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_285">[285]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Monsieur<a id="1_FNanchor_509" href="#1_Footnote_509" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 509">[509]</a> and Madame Mirepoix are come to pass
a few days here, but I imagine they will soon be tired
of us. The Justices of Peace have done great service
to the imprudent part of our company by prohibiting
gaming, and though you may suppose I do not number
myself among them, I feel my obligations to them on
account of the servants, who have one temptation less
to be idle and bad.”</p>

Princesse de Craon.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>She then adds grateful words to her husband, who
had written to say he had made a fresh will, and in her
favour. Mr. Montagu was then in London, but on the eve
of going north to attend to his own estates in Yorkshire,
and the complicated business of regulating Mr. Rogers’
affairs in Northumberland. In this letter he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I this day, though I could ill spare the time, dined in
Leicester Fields” (with the Scotts). “Being in the city
I was informed by Dr. Middleton’s bookseller that Mrs.
Middleton has had the good luck to sell Hildersham for
2000 guineas, it cost the Doctor, he said, £1600, besides
what he lay’d out in building, so that if there should be
some loss it cannot be much.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">HILDERSHAM</div>

<p>Hildersham was some miles from Cambridge. Here
Gray, the poet, loved to visit Conyers Middleton, and
improved his friendship with William Robinson, who
was preparing for Holy Orders, and whom Gray always
called the “Reverend Billy.”</p>

<p>On July 23 Mr. Montagu writes from Huntingdon—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I lay last night at Cambridge. I dined with Mrs.
Middleton in company with your brother, and the
evening I spent with the Master of Clare Hall. Mrs.
Middleton indulged me with the sight of some letters
that passed between the Doctor and a great man<a id="1_FNanchor_510" href="#1_Footnote_510" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 510">[510]</a> who
formerly had a seat not far from Cambridge, and who is

her custody, and promised also to keep it secret, which
I think you and I should also do, even from the brotherhood....
The races are to continue 4 days....</p>

<p>“I desire when wheatears are plenty and you send
any to your friends in London, you would send some

them.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISS MARIA NAYLOR</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu wishing to hear about the Huntingdon
races, he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can tell you little about the races, having no concern
in the bets, but I heard Lord Trentham had lost
£1000, Captain William Montagu £200. Lord Sandwich’s
horse won a heat, but he did not tell me how much
he won.</p>

<p>“At the ball all the family of the Naylors were

country dances. Miss Maria Naylor danced both kind

curiosities love something of every species. Mr. Wortley

<div class="sidenote">MISS ASHE</div>

<p>Miss Ashe, or the “Pollard Ashe,” as Walpole called
her, eloped with Edward Wortley Montagu in the
autumn of 1751. He was soon after this put in prison
with a Mr. Taafe in France for robbing or cheating a
Jew. As he was married before, though separated from
his wife, he could not marry Miss Ashe. She afterwards
married a Mr. Falconer, R.N.</p>

<p>It was in this year Horace Walpole had written to
Sir Horace Mann—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our greatest miracle is Lady Mary Wortley’s son
whose adventures have made so much noise, his parts
are not proportionate, but his expense is incredible.
His father scarce allows him anything, yet he plays,
dresses, diamonds himself, even to distinct shoe buckles<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_288">[288]</span>
for a frock, and has more snuff-boxes than would suffice
a Chinese idol with an hundred noses. But the most
curious part of his dress, which he has brought from
Paris, is an iron wig; you literally would not know it
from hair. I believe it is on this account that the Royal
Society have just chosen him of their body.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu wrote the description of “our cousin’s
adventures,” and after several comments on Wortley’s
conduct, she says, “Poor Miss Ashe weeps like the
forsaken Ariadne on a foreign shore.”</p>

<p>The company at Tunbridge Wells had been increased
by the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, the Duchess of
Norfolk, and, Mrs. Montagu writes, “we expect those
goddesses called the Gunnings and Sir Thomas
Robinson.... My Father is very gay, but complains
he never saw the place so dull. I never said so to
those about me, lest they should say to me as Swift

make the very crowd you blame!’ Mr. West reads to

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF MRS. PERCIVAL —<br>
DR. SHAW</div>

<p>At this period Mrs. Percival (Anne Donnellan’s
mother) died; she had long been in bad health. Dr.
Shaw, the celebrated traveller, died also, and Mrs.
Montagu comments thus on August 29 on the two events
to her husband, who was then at Newcastle—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As to poor Mrs. Percival I hailed her voyage to
the realms of rest: the last page of life is commonly a
blank. But for poor Shaw,<a id="1_FNanchor_519" href="#1_Footnote_519" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 519">[519]</a> he might have lived and
laughed and talked of the Deluge and collected cockle
shells many years longer. The death of those we
esteem afflicts us; we are shocked at the death of those
we have laughed<a id="1_FNanchor_520" href="#1_Footnote_520" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 520">[520]</a> at and laughed with, as we never<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_289">[289]</span>
looked upon them in so serious a light as to suppose so
sad an event could happen to them. I would deck his
tomb with emblems of all the wonders of the land and
deep; crocodiles should weep and tigers howl; every
shell should become vocal; sea-weed should bloom immortal
on his tomb, and moss, though petrified, lie
lightly on his breast. What signify voyages? What
signifies learning! Hebrew Professor! Traveller to
Memphis! Sole witness living of the present state of
the Ptolemies! Must all these glories sink into oblivion?
How gloriously had he been interred had he died in the
perilous pass of the Pyramids, and succeeded Mark
Anthony in the bed of Cleopatra! I hope the poor man
will have the satisfaction of being embalmed in the true
Egyptian manner, for the more like a mummy his body
be made, the more it will joy his gentle ghost. Nature
has lost the inventory of all works in losing Shaw, for
he knew every plant from the Hyssop to the Cedar of
Lebanon, and every animal from the pismire to the
whale. I am afraid his sister Sarah must again dust
down those cobwebs she has been taught to venerate,
and kill the moths in a stuff turban, though it should
have a horn more or a horn less.”</p>

<p>In a letter from Newcastle of September 1, Mr.
Montagu, who with his steward, Mr. Carter, was regulating
the business of his cousin, Mr. Rogers, mentions
Denton Hall<a id="1_FNanchor_521" href="#1_Footnote_521" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 521">[521]</a> for the first time, which was eventually to
become one of his residences.</p>

<p><a id="1_Footnote_521" href="#1_FNanchor_521" title="Return to text.">[521]</a> Note at the end of this work on Denton Hall.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Yesterday Mr. Carter and I rid to Denton, which
is about 3 miles from Newcastle. We first viewed the
house which is a good deal worse than I thought, and<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_290">[290]</span>
indeed so bad that it would not be justifiable to lay out
any money upon it. The rooms on the second floor are
pretty good, and served the family when they went
there, but if ever I should be so happy as to have your
company in these parts, if these should be thought fit I
would hope it would be no difficult matter to find you
some better accommodation. This next week I propose
to go to a Farm of Mr. R.’s at Jarrow, about ten miles
from Newcastle, and to Monk Seaton, where he has
another. I never have yet been at either of them.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">JARROW</div>

<p>Amongst his other property Mr. Rogers owned
much in coal mines, some of them entirely his own,
others in which, with the Claverings, Mr. Bowes, the
Bishop of Durham, etc., he owned a share. Mr. Montagu
was employing a Mr. Newton to value these—a
complicated, unfair business. Owing to Mr. Rogers’
lunacy, much advantage had been taken by dishonest
stewards and coal merchants, too long and complicated
for description in these pages. On September 8 Mr.
Montagu writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Friday last I was at a farm one half whereof
belongs to Mr. Rogers, the other to Sir Thomas Clavering,
called Jarrow, not far from Tynemouth, it is in the
parish where the Venerable Bede formerly practised.
Upon a Key this estate is obliged to contribute to for
the repair of all the Ships that come to this port, they
unload their ballast, which in length of time is become an
incredible heap. This estate is let at £107 10<i>s.</i> per <abbr title="annum">ann.</abbr>
To-morrow we go to Ravensworth, after which, when
we shall have visited Seaton and Rudchester, we shall
have seen all Mr. R.’s territories.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CARLISLE TURNPIKE ROAD</div>

<p>In the next letter he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“North Seaton lies upon the sea, consists of very
good land with coal under, and has a key and a granary
for corn and some quarrys of stone. The other estate<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_291">[291]</span>
of Rudchester is that through which the Carlisle Road
is to pass, and which with all the clamour of the tenants
will, as we think, be rather a benefit than hurt to the
estate. It is thought to have a good deal of good coal
in it, and but a very little way from the river Tyne, and
will be very valuable if ever the river should be made
navigable so high up as Mr. Carter thinks it may be in
twenty years’ time.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu also adds that he and Mr. Carter have
discovered that Mr. Rogers owned two-thirds of a
colliery at West Denton, of which they had not known.</p>

<p>On September 13 a son was born to the Dauphin<a id="1_FNanchor_522" href="#1_Footnote_522" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 522">[522]</a>
of France, and Mrs. Montagu writes on the 15th—</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="1_Footnote_522" href="#1_FNanchor_522" title="Return to text.">[522]</a> Louis, Duke of Burgundy, son of the Dauphin.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I hear Monsieur Mirepoix intends the town fine
illuminations and masquerades on the birth of the
Dauphin. I believe every miserable peasant in France
has great joy in the birth of one who is to be his future
tyrant. Strange infatuation!... I wish the English
loved their Island as well as the French do their
‘Monarque.’”<a id="1_FNanchor_523" href="#1_Footnote_523" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 523">[523]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the 22nd Mrs. Montagu writes to say she is
packing up for London, and she begs her husband,
who is thinking of moving southward, not to travel
with a single servant, as “every newspaper is filled
with accounts of robbery.” She congratulates him “on
having so well considered and settled Mr. Rogers’
affairs. It appears a noble estate, and I hope to see it
in your possession who would nobly enjoy it.”</p>

<p>Matthew Robinson had been in Yorkshire, and
thence travelled to Scotland, then little visited. Mrs.
Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I suppose my brother Robinson is by this time
returning to the known world. I expect to hear he<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_292">[292]</span>
has travelled to the extremity of Scotland, for he is a
man of infinite curiosity, and would have knowledge at
no entrance quite shut out.”</p>
</div>

<p>To this her husband rejoins, “Whenever I come
near London I will hire a guard, and if I can give you
sufficient notice shall not be sorry to be met by
Brunton....” He says he has not heard of Brother
Robinson since he dined with him. “If he has gone to
Scotland, I have lately read in a book concerning the
Rebellion, that barbarous part of our island may in
good weather be seen with pleasure!” In return, his
wife writes from London that she is going to Hayes
“to enjoy quiet and my books till you arrive. I take
Mrs. Isted with me.” Mrs. Isted was a poor lady who
acted as housekeeper to Mrs. Montagu, and had seen
better days.</p>

<p>The Scotts had been dining with her. They were
then living at Chelsea, as London did not suit Sarah’s
delicate health. A scheme of education for the young
princes had been drawn up and submitted to the King,
who was much pleased with it. It was also rumoured
he was to take them to Hanover next year, “a step
which will not be popular.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. MIDDLETON’S WORKS</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Middleton’s works are to be printed by the
booksellers by subscription. Mrs. Middleton sold the
copies for £300: it seems to me an insolence in the
booksellers that should not be encouraged. I should
never grudge the guinea I could spare to a man of
genius, but to a set of wretches that live by other
people’s wits, I am not so willing to part with that
gold which the wise man allows to be better than anything
except wisdom. It is strange malice in Apollo
to make poor authors and rich booksellers, he should
give his upper servants the best wages.”</p>
</div>

<p>From Hayes, on September 30, she writes—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_293">[293]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am so well in health that I scarce know myself,
and I think I am a little like the humorous Lieutenant
that would run no hazards when he was well, though
he was prodigal of life when he had a pain in his side.
I am very desirous to preserve this comfortable state of
health, and also my comely, plump and jolly condition;
my face is no longer a <i>memento mori</i>. I am like one of
the goddess Hebe’s elder sisters, ‘Not ever fair and
young, but not so wan and decayed as of late.’” She
adds, “Lady Bab and my sister design to visit my
solitude in a few days. She is much better for country
air, but they do not enjoy many rural pleasures at
Chelsea, it is too near London.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. DONNELLAN —<br>
JOURNEY TO IRELAND</div>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan, having let her house to Lord Holderness,
was preparing to go to Ireland to visit Dr. and
Mrs. Delany at Delville, and her relations. She was
staying with her friends the Southwells, at King’s
Weston, and as her letters throw light on the then
mode of travelling, I insert portions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Delville, near Dublin, October 7.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Montagu</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I am sure will be pleased to hear I am got
safe to the end of my journeys and voyage, and am with
my good friend Mrs. Delany resting myself after a good
deal of fatigue. I left London as I told you I should, as
I informed you by a letter from King’s Weston, which
I hope you got. Mr. Leslie, the gentleman who took the
charge of conducting me to Ireland, came at the time
appointed, but we heard so bad an account of the cross
roads between Bristol and Chester that we were very
near setting out again for London, and going from thence
to Chester. However, I plucked up courage, and as
my good friends would do everything to accommodate
me, we set out on Thursday sen’night with Mr. Southwell’s
coach, two post-chaises and Mr. Southwell’s groom
and double horse,<a id="1_FNanchor_524" href="#1_Footnote_524" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 524">[524]</a> so that we had variety enough. The<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_294">[294]</span>
road for the greatest part to Gloucester was so bad I
rid most of it, but hearing it would rather mend I sent
back the coach, and between the chaise and the horse
got to Chester and on to Park Gate in five days, and
Mr. Leslie my companion, being a very sensible, polite
travelled man, made the journey as agreeable as such a
journey could be. We found Lord and Lady Fitzwilliams
and many more waiting at Park Gate for the
King’s Yacht, but as I hate a crowded ship and am not
a coward, I resolved not to wait, and the wind being
fair, we hired a small ship for ten guineas and set sail.
The next morning at six o’clock and with the finest
weather imaginable made our passage and landed in
Dublin in 30 hours. The Bishop of Clogher, who had
been enquiring for me the morning tide, came to the
house when I was landed, with his usual politeness, and
carried me to their house, and as it was too late to come
here, they kept me that night, and the next day Mrs.
Delany came and brought me here, where I am extremely
happy, the most polite and hearty welcome, a
large and convenient house, sweet gardens and a manner
of living quite to my sober taste. Our only disturbance
are visitors: we had yesterday seven coaches and six,
mostly my own relations, my brother, sister, nephews
and nieces.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DAUPHIN</div>

<p>On October 31 there is a letter dated from London
to Mr. Gilbert West. In this Mrs. Montagu is forwarding
him patterns of all kinds of dove-coloured paper from
Mr. Bromedge’s shop, and Mr. Linnell was sending a
marble chimney-piece for West’s big room at Wickham.
She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Poor Dr. Courayer notified to me that he was ill of
a sore throat, and could not come to visit me, though he
wanted to see me. I went to him, I was obliged to pass
through all the gay vanities of Mrs. Chenevix,<a id="1_FNanchor_525" href="#1_Footnote_525" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 525">[525]</a> and then
ascend a most steep and difficult staircase to get at<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_295">[295]</span>
the little Philosopher: this way to wisdom through the
vanities and splendid toys of the world might be prettily
allegorized by the pen of the great Bunyan; the good
man himself to an emblematizeing genius would have
afforded an ample subject; his head was <i>enfoncé</i> in a
cap of the warmest beaver, made still more respectable
by a gold orrace, ‘a wondrous hieroglyphick robe he
wore,’ in which was portrayed all the attributes of the
god Fo, with the arms and delineaments of the Cham
of Tartary.... I began to consider him as the best
piece of Chinese furniture I had ever seen, and could
hardly forbear offering him a place on my chimney-piece.
He asked much after your health.... There
has been a terrible fracas in the court of the grand
Monarque, the people, generally credulous, have strangely
taken it into their heads that the Duke of Burgundy is
not legitimate, and instead of acclamations and huzzas,
murmurs and sighs have echo’d through the streets, on
the days the feasts were made for the birth of this child;
besides this there was conveyed into the cradle some
gunpowder and a match with an epigram expressing
that they would serve to blow up the pretended Duke
of Burgundy. Upon his Majesty hearing this, the
gouvernante, sub-gouvernante, women of the bedchamber,
even to the toothless pap tasters, were all sent
to the Bastille, one of the women who said she saw a
hand reach over a screen to throw a paper into the
cradle is since dead. A little knowledge is allowed to
be a dangerous thing; had the lady been able to inform
his Majesty at once who threw the paper, she had been
safe, but it is supposed the hand that threw it, lest she
should discover more, gave her a dose that has silenced
her for ever....</p>

<p>“The Duke and Duchess of Portland and Lord
Titchfield dined with us to-day, and staid till eight
o’clock; her grace inquired after you.”</p>

<p>The last letter of the year is on December 17, to
Mr. West, from Sandleford. From this it appears Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="1_Page_296">[296]</span>
Montagu was extremely unwell, but anxious for the
health of Mr. West, who had had one of his periodical
gout attacks, which had rendered his hands temporarily
incapable of use. In this mention of Mr. Hooke is
made. Mr. Nathaniel Hooke<a id="1_FNanchor_526" href="#1_Footnote_526" class="fnanchor" title="Go to volume 1 footnote 526">[526]</a> wrote a “<cite>History of
Rome</cite>,” and other works. He assisted the old Duchess
of Marlborough to write her “<cite>Memoirs of her Life</cite>,” for
which she gave him £5000. He was a Roman Catholic,
a disciple of Fenelon’s, and brought a Catholic priest to
Pope on his death-bed. “Pray have you made a good
Protestant of Mr. Hooke? If you cure heresy and
schism, should you not have your doctor’s degree in
divinity rather than law?”</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="2_FNanchor_1" href="#2_Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><i>January 1, 1752</i>, an interchange of letters and compliments
from the Wests and Mrs. Montagu take place.
Mrs. West sends a huge turkey and ham pie, half for
Mrs. Montagu, half for Temple West, Gilbert’s brother.
Mr. Pitt, Lady Cobham, and Berenger were expected.
In a letter to her sister, Sarah Scott, Mrs. Montagu
mentions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My Father is going to purchase a fine living for
Willy, indeed he will not enjoy it till after the death of
the present incumbent, but it brings in £470 a year, a
fine reversion for a younger brother, and what, joined
to another moderate living, will be a comfortable subsistence.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was the living of Burghfield in Berkshire,
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_2">[2]</span>purchased from the Shrewsbury family, for two lives, of
which in after years William Robinson became rector,
his son Matthew succeeding him. Further in this letter
it says—</p>

The Doctor talks of Bath for his health, but he is the
best-looking invalid I ever saw. An Irish Bishopric
will cure him entirely. Mrs. Delany is not in England.
Poor Mrs. Donnellan has lost her brother, Dr. Donnellan,<a id="2_FNanchor_4" href="#2_Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>

was chaplain to the Duke of Dorset, then Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland, and had just been made Bishop of
Killala. They were immense men, with fine features
and rosy cheeks. Mr. Richard Cumberland<a id="2_FNanchor_6" href="#2_Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> calls Dr.
Richard Robinson “a colossal man.” So attached was
Sir William to his brother Richard that Cumberland
says he imitated the Archbishop in everything, even to
the size of his shoes, diet, and physic!</p>

<p>“I feel very sensibly the distress of Mr. Botham and

my Patronages lye, I cannot find that I have any living
within distance of Albury, unless it be in the City of

<p>“Mrs. Sherlock desires to join me in respects to you

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<p>In March, Mr. Pitt obtained for Mr. Gilbert West the
clerkship of the Privy Council, a lucrative office.</p>

<p>On March 25, from Hayes to Wickham, Mrs. Montagu
writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I thank you most heartily for immediately
giving me the sincerest joy I have felt for this long
time. May you long enjoy what you have so late
attained.... You cannot imagine the pleasure I propose
in hearing your friends congratulate you on
Fortune’s first courtesy. Base Jade! to be so tedious
and so sparing in her favours.”</p>
</div>

<p>With many congratulations to Mrs. West, etc., to
which Lydia Botham, then at Hayes, added a few lines,
Mrs. Montagu announces she will convey him and Mrs.
West to London the next morning in her post-chaise,
and they shall stay in Hill Street, where Mr. Montagu
was attending to his parliamentary business; and, she
adds, to fix an hour “so as to be with the President of
the Council at 12 o’clock.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. WILLIAM CHESILDEN</div>

<p>From London, on April 17, Mr. Montagu writes an
account of the celebrated surgeon, Dr. William Chesilden’s
death—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The papers, I suppose, have informed you of the
death of poor Chesilden. I had an account of the
manner of his death from one Mr. Vourse, an eminent
man in his own profession. He told me the poor man
was with Jerry Pierce and others, telling them how
soon after his being seized with the Palsy he had been
making a bargain with an undertaker to bury him, with
this he was entertaining them with his usual humour,
and in the midst of his story was seiz’d with an apoplectic
fit which finish’d him in half an hour.... I forgot to
add that Mr. Chesilden had eat a great deal of Bread
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_5">[5]</span>and drank a good quantity of ale; being asthmatic, this
was reckoned to be the cause of his death.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCOTT SEPARATION</div>

<p>It will be remembered that Mrs. Montagu was
always opposed to her sister Sarah’s marriage to
George Lewis Scott. Unfortunately, her fears as to
their felicity were prophetic, for in April, 1752, after
only a year’s matrimony, they separated; incompatibility
of temper was alleged, but from the letters there was
evidently much more below the surface. Mrs. Delany,
writing in April to her sister, Mrs. D’Ewes, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What a foolish match Mrs. Scott has made for herself.
Mrs. Montagu wrote Mrs. Donnellan word that
she and the rest of her friends had rescued her out of
the hands of a very bad man: but for reasons of interest,
they should conceal his misbehaviour as much as possible,
but entreated Mrs. Donnellan would vindicate her
sister’s character whenever she heard it attacked, for
she was very innocent.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sarah was only twenty-nine. Her father and brothers
separated her from Mr. Scott, as is shown in his own
letters to Mr. Montagu, who had been his original
friend. He acknowledged “that Mrs. Montagu knew
nothing of the separation till it was communicated to
her;” in truth she was at Hayes at the time. Her letters
indicate the enmity and rancour of a great lady whose
name was kept behind the scenes. Mr. Scott wrote two
letters to Mr. Montagu, dated April 29 and May 1, but
both are so involved and mysterious as to shed no real
light on his misdemeanours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Montagu received Mrs. Scott at
Hayes, and in a letter to her husband, whom she was
preparing to join in London, says Morris was urging
Mrs. Scott to go to Albury. She says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I could leave her at Hayes when I go to town, but
her spirits are so bad and she is so ill she cannot be
alone.... Indeed, poor creature, her situation is miserable,
allied to the faults and the infamy of a bad man,
subject to his aspersions, and liable to the censures of
his friends (for the worst have some), as in all disagreements
in wedlock, blame falls ever on the innocent
where there is no harmony. ‘How happy to behold in
wedded pair!’ each has the credit of the other’s virtues;
they have double honour, united interests and all that
can make people strong in society. This, my Dearest,
is my happier lot, inriched by your fortune, ennobled by
your virtues, graced by your character, and supported
by your interest.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu accompanied Mrs. Scott to Albury.
She writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We had a very pleasant journey here, and our
horses performed well. We found Lydia and Johnny in
health and happiness, surrounded by five of the finest
children I ever saw; the youngest boy is a little cherubim
and has the finest white hair imaginable.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A SEDAN CHAIR — THE SCOTTS</div>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan, in May, writes from Delville, where
she still was, to Mrs. Montagu, to say that Lord Holderness
was to give up her house in Hanover Square about
August, and as it was too large for her fortune, and
the lease was near its end,<a id="2_FNanchor_8" href="#2_Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> she wishes Mrs. Montagu to
look out for a house for her “not farther than Windsor
from London. Soon after our return, the Dean and
Mrs. Delany go to Down, and I fear his affairs will not
permit him to go to England this year.” She adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have writ to Mrs. Shuttleworth to bespeak me
a chair of Vaughan.<a id="2_FNanchor_9" href="#2_Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I would have it plain and light,
lined with white cloath and green curtains, as white and<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_7">[7]</span>
green is my livery. If you should go to town, I should
be obliged to you if you would send to Vaughan about
it....</p>

<p>“I now come to the interesting part of your letter,
the unhappy affair of poor Mrs. Scott. I had heard
before I received yours that she and Mr. Scott were
parted, but could hardly believe it, a match so much of
mutual inclination seemed to promise mutual happiness,
and the shortness of the time of their union hardly
allowed them to find out they were not happy, so that
you are unwilling to hurt the gentleman in his character.
I must conclude he is very bad, since in so short a time he
could force Mrs. Scott and all her family to come to such an
<i>éclat</i>. I am extremely concerned for all the uneasiness
you have had on the occasion, but you have had the
consolation of showing yourself a most generous and
kind sister in supporting her in her misfortunes, and
especially as it was a match made against your better
judgment. I beg my compliments to Mrs. Scott, and
I heartily wish her health and spirits to support her
situation; ’tis said here she is returning to Bath to live
with Lady Montagu. On these occasions people love to
seem to know more than perhaps they do; all I say is
that you entirely justify Mrs. Scott, and I am sure you
must know the truth. I hear, too, he has given her back
half her fortune, and has settled a 150 pounds a year on
her; this, I think, is a justification to her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu had indeed a great deal of trouble at
this time, for besides sheltering and endeavouring to
cheer Mrs. Scott’s failing spirits, she had, to say nothing
of her own constant ill-health, the additional trouble of
her favourite brother Jack’s illness, now continuing
some months, of a nervous disorder, which he never
recovered from.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOUTH LODGE — THE REV. WILLIAM ROBINSON</div>

<p>On May 26, from Sandleford, Mrs. Montagu writes to
Mr. West, who is at her house in Hill Street, attending
as clerk to the Privy Council—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I was informed by Mrs. Isted<a id="2_FNanchor_10" href="#2_Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that you intended
to return to town in the middle of this week, so
I imagine that by this time you are in the Empire of
China.<a id="2_FNanchor_11" href="#2_Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The leafless trees and barren soil of my landscape
will very ill bear comparison with the shady oaks
and beautiful verdure of South Lodge, and the grinning
Mandarins still worse supply the place of a British
Statesman: but as you can improve every society and
place into which you enter, I expect such hints from you
as will set off the figures, and enliven the landscape with
rural beauty. I grieved at the rain from an apprehension
that it might interfere with your pleasure at South
Lodge. I hope it did not, but that you saw the place
with the leisure and attention it deserves; if you give
me an account of the parts of it which charmed you
most, or of the whole, you will lead my imagination to
a very fine place in very good company, and I shall
walk over it with great pleasure. I imagine you would
feel some poetic enthusiasm in the Temple of Pan, and
hope it produced a hymn or ode in which we shall see
him knit with the Graces and the Hours to dance, lead
on to the Eternal Spring, through groves of your unfading
bays.”</p>
</div>

<p>South Lodge, Enfield, was then the residence of Mr.
Pitt, the grounds of which he laid out with great taste,
and designed the Temple of Pan. Mrs. Montagu had
recently been on a visit to him here, as will be seen in
West’s answer. At the end of a long letter, which contains
directions as to the ornaments of her room, comments
on her bad health, in which she quotes Pope’s
saying, “ill-health is an early old age,” she winds up
with regretting that Sir George Lyttelton and Miss
West were going to Tunbridge so soon, for “I fear<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_9">[9]</span>
they will leave the place the earlier, as they go at the
beginning of the season.” She finishes by commending
her brother William, who was to spend a day or two in
Hill Street, to West, saying—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wrote my advice to him to take this opportunity
to pay his respects to you, but possibly a little College
awkwardness, added to natural timidity, may prevent his
doing it. I assure you he is a very good young man,
more I will not say, for having for some years had a
mother’s care of him, I have also a mother’s partiality:
perhaps you may like him the better for his resemblance
to your son.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Pitt, as you will easily imagine from your own
experience, received and entertained us with great politeness,
and something still more pleasing and solid, with
every mark of friendship and esteem. He had provided
for me a wheeling chair, by the help of which I was
enabled to visit every sequestered nook, dingle and
bosky bower from side to side in that little paradise
opened in the wild, and by the help of my imagination
doubled the pleasure I received from the various Beauties
of Art and Nature, by recalling and participating the

ardour in viewing a fine place, and an almost implicit
faith in Mr. Pitt’s taste and judgment, stole out often by
herself, and in defiance of wind or rain walked many
times over the enchanting round.... Kitty<a id="2_FNanchor_14" href="#2_Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> has seemed
to be inspired with an unusual flow of spirits, which not

<div class="sidenote">CAPTAIN ROBERT ROBINSON — “CHINESE POMP”</div>

<p>Captain Robinson returned from his Chinese expedition
in the <i>Saint George</i> the middle of June, and Mrs.
Montagu and Mrs. Scott met him from Sandleford at
her villa at Hayes. “He has brought me two beautiful
gowns and a fine Chinese lanthorn. We are to go on
board the <i>St. George</i> to-morrow,” she writes to her husband.
He also brought a gown apiece for Lady Sandwich
and her sister, Miss Fane. The greater part of
the Robinson family went to dine on the <i>Saint George</i>,
but on a stormy day, and Mrs. Montagu was very terrified
at the tossing of the small boat they went in. Soon<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_11">[11]</span>
after this, in the beginning of July, Mrs. Montagu left
for her annual visit to Tunbridge Wells, where she had
taken the “White Stone House” on Mount Ephraim.
Sarah Scott returned to Sandleford to Mr. Montagu,
<i>en route</i> for Bath, where she was about to take up
residence with her friend, Lady Bab Montagu. At
Tunbridge were Sir George and Lady Lyttelton, Mr.
West, Miss Charlotte Fane, Mr. Garrick, Mr. Bower,
the Dean of Exeter, General Pulteney,<a id="2_FNanchor_15" href="#2_Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> etc. At a big

<div class="sidenote">“A COLD LOAF”</div>

<p>Mr. West from Tunbridge visited his cousins, the
Bothams, at Albury, and found Lydia in a terrible state
of health, and worried with the preparation of her five
children to be inoculated. He persuaded her to go to
Tunbridge to consult Dr. Shaw, and writes from Stoke
to Mrs. Montagu to suggest that Mrs. Botham should
stay with her at Sandleford whilst the children are
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_12">[12]</span>inoculated, and left in their father’s care. He mentions
Mr. Hooke being in a cottage near Stoke, very busy
writing. Lydia Botham, despite of all entreaties, returned
to Albury to remain with her children. Mrs. Montagu
contemplated a visit to Horton, <i>alias</i> Mount Morris, with
her husband, to stay with her brother Matthew, but
violent rheumatism attacked her in the shoulders. She
was reluctantly obliged to let Mr. Montagu visit “the
brethren,” as they termed them, alone. Meanwhile,
West, not being satisfied with the tutor with whom his
son was residing, hastened to Hill Street to remove him
to Oxford. Mrs. Medows<a id="2_FNanchor_17" href="#2_Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> writes from Chute on
October 3 to say she had taken her nieces, the Miss
Pulses, to see Sandleford, where they ate “a cold loaf,”<a id="2_FNanchor_18" href="#2_Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and “I was not a little exalted as a planter when I saw
chestnuts I had set nuts, five and forty feet high.” She
mentions that Mrs. Isted gave them a great many good
things, “and showed several pretty pieces of her painting,
and one of your curtains finished and a handkerchief
the little girl you are so good as to take care of is
making for you, that will look very like point.”</p>

and arrived at Canterbury, where he ascended the
Cathedral tower for the view, his first sight of that
place. His first letter crossed one of his wife’s, in
which she laments her inability to accompany him, and
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I suppose you will see the place with great veneration,

where I spent the careless days of infancy and the
more gay ones of early youth with satisfaction. To the<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_13">[13]</span>
Fair, the years from 15 to 20 are very agreeable.” She
continues, “When do my brethren come to town? I
hear my brother Robinson stays to cultivate the
maternal acres. As to the Paternal they will not come
yet. I think he will think of the Père Eternel when
he does not say the Lord’s Prayer. I design to go to

<p>“I am sorry your horse does not like hard roads,

I have never before now had an opportunity of sufficiently
observing this house, which is very large and
perfectly regular, though it is not placed just where
one could wish it, ’tis easy to see is capable of great
improvement by openings and cuttings in a good deal
of that fine prospect which is now shut out by the walls
and trees; and by grubbing up the bushes and hedges
and making a kind of Paddock on the South side of the
house. A bason of water like that at Newbold might
also be easily made.... Some of these things the
worthy owner is not without having some thoughts of
doing, as well as cutting some walks and vistas through
his wood.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is a picture of Mount Morris in <cite>Harris’
‘History of Kent,’</cite> 1719, a large square house with a
cupola surmounted by a big ball and weathercock. In
front of the house and round it are the small walled
gardens, formally planted, the fashion of the period.
These were eventually pulled down by Matthew Robinson,
the hedges grubbed and all thrown into one large
park,<a id="2_FNanchor_19" href="#2_Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in which his numerous horses and cattle roamed<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_15">[15]</span>

<div class="sidenote">ARCHIBALD BOWER</div>

<p>Visits to the Scotts of Scotts Hall, the Brockmans of
Beachborough, etc., are spoken of. In a letter of the
same date, October 12, to her husband, Mrs. Montagu
first mentions Archibald Bower<a id="2_FNanchor_20" href="#2_Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and his wife.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="2_Footnote_20" href="#2_FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> Archibald Bower, born 1686, died 1766; wrote “<cite>The History of
the Popes</cite>,” etc., etc.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>To give the whole biography of Archibald Bower
would take too much space in this book. An account of
him can be found in the “<cite>National Biography,” <abbr title="volume 6">vol. vi</abbr>.
p. 48</cite>. He was a Scotsman, was sent to Douai, and
entered the Jesuit Society in 1706. In 1717 he studied
Divinity at Rome; became Reader of Philosophy and
Adviser to the College of Arezzo. Horrified at the
“hellish proceedings” of the Court of Inquisition, where
he witnessed the torture of two innocent gentlemen, he
fled to England, and while there made the acquaintance
of Dean Berkeley, the old admirer and friend of Mrs.
Donnellan, who was afterwards Bishop of Cloyne. He
entered, as tutor, the family of Mr. Thompson, Coley
Park, Berks, and afterwards that of Lord Aylmer. He
revised the “<cite>Universal History</cite>.” In 1748 he was made
keeper of the Queen’s Library, and in 1749 he married
a widow with one child, a niece of Bishop Nicholson.
His first volume of his “<cite>History of the Popes</cite>” was
published in 1748, the second in 1751, the third in 1753.
Though renouncing the Jesuit order, he seems to have
had business dealings with the Society, some of which
brought him into considerable obloquy, but they are
too lengthy to be detailed here.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu, returning to Hayes, says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_16">[16]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Bower and his wife are to come to me on
Friday, and stay till Saturday or Monday, he is a very
merry entertaining companion. He left all gloominess
in that seat of horrors—the Inquisition. I breakfasted
with him on Tuesday, he is but between two or three
miles from Hayes. His wife is civil and silent, so I asked
her to come over with him. I never saw any country
more beautiful than about Chislehurst, where he lives.
I cannot say much in praise of his habitation, which he
terms his Paradise, but indeed to a mind so gay and
cheerful as his, all places are a Paradise. He is much
engaged with those old ladies, the Popes, but says he
will leave the Santi Padri for his Madonna. He will
teach me the pronunciation of Italian, which he has
reduced to a Method, so it may easily be acquired. He
taught it to Mr. Garrick at Tunbridge.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">“MADONNA”</div>

<p>Apparently Bower was introduced to Mrs. Montagu
by Gilbert West. He was an intimate friend of Sir
George Lyttelton. Both he and Sir George gave Mrs.
Montagu the sobriquet of “Madonna,” but as Bower’s
first letter of 1753 addresses her as “Madonna,” with
him probably the nickname originated. They corresponded
for some years in Italian.</p>

<p>In the next letter of October 14, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Bowers came here yesterday. Mr. and Mrs.

which is now in high beauty.”</p>

<p>The five Botham children had been inoculated!
Their mother had been persuaded in her bad health to
leave them in their father’s care. Lydia, writing to
Mrs. Montagu to thank her for a present of Madeira,
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will desire to hear something of my Babes.
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_17">[17]</span>My letter from their good Father to-day says they were
well when he wrote, but that my kind and humane
friends, Dr. Shaw and Winchester, who had both been
with them in the morning, said their eyes were so heavy
and their pulses so loaded that they would not hold up
long.”</p>
</div>

<p>A postscript to this letter gives the next day’s
account in Mr. Botham’s words—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My dear Babes are all drooping round me, and
wonder not if I tell you I am glad they are so, since
from the gentlest symptoms of the distemper I have a
good foundation to hope they will do well. They are
sometimes up and sometimes down, and sicken so
gradually that Winchester doubts not that they will
have a favourable sort of the smallpox. I expect they
will be in their beds to-morrow.”</p>
</div>

<p>By November 16 the five children were well, and
Mrs. Montagu writes to Mr. West from Sandleford—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mrs. Botham returns to her little family to-morrow,
they are all quite recovered, and I hope this lucky event
will hasten the recovery of my Lydia. I should indeed
be glad to behold the happy smile that will illuminate
her countenance at her return to her babes. Mr.
Rogers<a id="2_FNanchor_21" href="#2_Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> is recovering from another mortification....
I really believe he will live to the age of Methuselah,
for he recovers of those illnesses which destroy the
strongest.</p>

<p>“I find the Princess of Wales will have a drawing-room
as soon as the King returns, and I hope you will
consult with your friends, whether it will not be proper
you should appear there.... Mr. Linnell<a id="2_FNanchor_22" href="#2_Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> brought me<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_18">[18]</span>
his bill the morning I left town, and I think I will send a
copy of it as a proper warning to your Mrs. West, and
if you will still proceed in spite of my sad and woeful
example, I cannot help it. I shall repent my misdeeds
as the daughters of Israel did theirs in sackcloth and
ashes. Adieu Brocade, Embroidery, and lace, and even
the cheaper vanities of lutestring and blonde.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEW BOOKS</div>

<p>In a letter to Miss Anstey from Mrs. Montagu, of
November 23, we gain a glimpse of the books being read
then—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Hooke has published a second edition of his
‘<cite>Roman History</cite>,’ which is much admired. Mr.

The Duke of Cumberland has been dangerously ill,

<div class="sidenote">“HISTORY OF THE POPES”</div>

<p>Gilbert West was busied at this time planting his
garden at Wickham with firs and laurels, and Mrs.
Montagu teased him by letter about his “evergreen-nevergreen
garden,” as she called it. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Remember that while you avoid winter, you exclude
Spring, and forbid the glad return of the vernal season,
as well as the sad approach of autumn. In your garden
and in your life, may all that is necessary for shade, for
shelter and for comfort be permanent and unchanged.
May the pleasures and aromatics be various, successive,
sweet and new! ... I shall be much obliged to you if
when you see the incomparable Mr. Bower you will get
of him the second volume of the ‘<cite>History of the Popes</cite>.’
I have almost finished Mr. Hooke’s history. I do not
care to quit the city of Rome till I have seen the establishment
of its spiritual Monarchy.... I have just
received a collection of letters, wrote by Madame de
Maintenon, though Voltaire has diminished my opinion
of her in some degree; yet I have an impatience to open
the book.... I shall like to see what alteration there is
in her from the wife and widow of poor Scarron to
becoming the consort of Louis le Grand.”</p>
</div>

<p>On December 2 Lady Courtenay sent feathers and
shells to Mrs. Montagu for her work. She was the
daughter of Heneage, 2nd Lord Aylesford, and married
to Sir William Courtenay, afterwards 1st Viscount
Courtenay. She was a sister of Lady Andover’s, and a
great friend of Lydia Botham’s, and in this letter expresses
great concern at Lydia’s sad state of health.</p>

<p>On December 29 Mrs. Montagu writes to her sister
Sarah that she had sustained the great loss of her lady
housekeeper, Mrs. Isted, who had died very suddenly
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_20">[20]</span>whilst Mr. and Mrs. Montagu had been spending a few
days with Lydia Botham. The latter was then supposed
to be dying.</p>

<p>From the letters it appears Mrs. Isted was a widow
lady, who had lost an only child, and had been known to
Mrs. Montagu in her more prosperous years. Lydia
Botham rallied for a time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GEORGE LEWIS SCOTT</div>

<p>A great dispute was going on at Leicester House
at this time on the subject of Prince George’s tutors.
Amongst the sub-preceptors, it will be remembered,
was Mr. George Lewis Scott, Sarah’s (<i>née</i> Robinson)
husband. Soon after this he was dismissed from the
list of tutors. One reason alleged was that he was a
Jacobite, but there was little ground for this supposition.
Though a clever man, he seems to have been
quite an unsuitable person to be tutor to the princes,
and Mrs. Montagu comforts Sarah by saying his true
character will now appear. “You will see shortly that
he and you will have justice done you, and with this
difference, that to you it will be a guardian angel, to
him an avenging minister. In the mean time ‘leave him
to Heaven, and the thorns that prick his bosom,’ as says
good Mr. Hamlet.”</p>

<p>On December 23 she had an assembly, and writes
to Mrs. Boscawen that “the Chinese Room was filled
by a succession of people from eleven in the morning
till eleven at night.”</p>

<p>The year ends with a letter to Gilbert West, who
had had a terrible attack of gout, sending him Birch’s<a id="2_FNanchor_29" href="#2_Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
“<cite>Life of Archbishop Tillotson</cite>,”<a id="2_FNanchor_30" href="#2_Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> “which Mr. Birch left

<div class="year">1753</div>

<p>1753 opens with a letter from Mrs. Donnellan on
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_21">[21]</span>January 2, to Mrs. Montagu, then at Sandleford. In this
she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Two letters from Ireland informed me of a sort of
determination both of Dr. Delany’s affair and my own.
I had a very particular account of both from my Six
Clerk and Manager, Mr. Croker, who is Six Clerk to
Delany’s adversarys, and a short letter from Mrs. Delany.
My Lord Chancellor has acquitted Dr. Delany of a hard
word in the law, called spoliation, but has ordered an
account before two masters in Chancery to be taken of
all the late Mrs. Delany’s personal estate, and what she
was worth when she married the Dean.”</p>
</div>

<p>This law-suit, which lasted some years, and was a
great annoyance and expense to the Delanys, was caused
by his having inadvertently burnt a paper of importance
belonging to his first wife. Mrs. Donnellan’s brother
had claimed the lease of the house lately belonging to
their mother, in London, owing to a defect in the execution
of the will. Mrs. Donnellan got the books, and
some few hundred pounds, but, as she had been residuary
legatee in the will, suffered severe loss which she bore
with exemplary patience.</p>

<p>It is probable that at this period her brother-in-law,
Bishop Clayton, being wealthy and generous, gave up
his wife’s marriage portion to her sister, Anne Donnellan.</p>

<p>Anne now took a house in Bolton Row, London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TURKEY PYE</div>

<p>On January 3 Mrs. Montagu writes to thank Mrs.
West for a portion of Turkey “pye,” and some verses
of her composing with it. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“January 3.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“For your pye and your verses what strains
are sublime enough to return proper thanks! You have
held the balance of justice so exactly and directed its
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_22">[22]</span>sword so well where to fall that Mrs. Temple West and
I are determined to divide the pye this evening according
to the rules prescribed. Though our pye has not
yet been toasted, your verses have been well relish’d
by some of the greatest connoisseurs. About an hour
after I had your letter Miss West came to call on me; I
communicated your poetic strains and we were very
merry over them. When Lord Temple and Sir George
Lyttelton came in we let them have a share, and they
joined in the laugh and commendation. Lord Temple
desired his best and kindest compliments to you and
my cousin. He is not at all the worse for his late
illness.... Sir George and he were going to dine with
Mr. Pitt, whose health, I believe, is in much the same
state as when you saw him.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUCHESS OF CHANDOS</div>

<p>Mrs. Medows wrote on January 6 from Chute,
Wilton, then her brother-in-law’s residence, to wish the
Montagus a happy new year, and in this letter she
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Duke of C(handos)<a id="2_FNanchor_31" href="#2_Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> our neighbour kept his
Son’s<a id="2_FNanchor_32" href="#2_Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> birthday with great magnificence. I was invited,
and not foreseeing such an occasion for dress, I had
neither manto nor sack, and desired leave to come in a
white apron in the evening, but the Duchess insisted on
my coming with it to dinner. You may imagine how well
I dined on two and forty dishes, and a dessert of one and
twenty, very well ordered and served; but the Duchess’s
behaviour was really an entertainment, not in the least
embarrassed, she did the honours perfectly well, and
seemed conscious she should make a good figure, and
pleased with the opportunity. In the evening there was
a ball, cards for the grave people. I am pleased to find
that I can still see the young people dance and with
pleasure; our nieces<a id="2_FNanchor_33" href="#2_Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Pulses were the best dancers. I
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_23">[23]</span>won four rubbers and past for a good player; content
with this, I came away before supper. I was charmed
with Mrs. Ironmonger<a id="2_FNanchor_34" href="#2_Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> ... If you would have me think
you well get a Vandike Hankerchief. Mrs. Ironmonger
had one, and I am sure it will become you.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POET GRAY</div>

<p>January 18, Miss Anstey, writing from Trumpington,
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Have you heard that Mr. Gray<a id="2_FNanchor_35" href="#2_Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> is going to publish
his whole stock of poetry, which, though it will consist
of only one volume, and contains but few things which
have not been already printed, the price will be half a
guinea; but what seems most extraordinary, it is expected
there will be a very great demand for them, and
I am told there is already a great number bespoke, for
they are to be embellished and illustrated in the most
curious and ingenious manner with copper plates drawn
and imagined by Mr. Bentley.<a id="2_FNanchor_36" href="#2_Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> I hear they are all very
clever, and was told for a specimen that the little ode on
the cat is to have in the frontispiece the Fates cutting
her nine threads of her life, and the rats and mice exulting
upon the death of their enemy. At the end Puss is
represented as just landed from Charon’s Boat, and in
her approach towards Pluto’s Palace, she sets up her
back and spits at Cerberus. How do you like the conceit?
They are said to be very highly drawn, and Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_24">[24]</span>Gray gives his poetry. Mr. Horace Walpole<a id="2_FNanchor_37" href="#2_Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> is at the
whole expense of the printing and copper plates for the
benefit of Mr. Bentley....</p>

<p>“I hear the scholar<a id="2_FNanchor_38" href="#2_Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of St. John’s who has admitted
himself of the play house performs much better in a
personated than he did here in his real character. I
suppose he does not regret his being expelled the
University, as he finds himself well received by the
Town, for excommunication would not hurt him there.
I hear he is really a good actor, which is a thing, I am
afraid, much more rare than a bad clergyman, so I am
glad he has taken to the stage instead of the Pulpit. I
hear there were fourscore of this University present at
his first performance, and that if he has a benefit the
whole body will be present at it.”</p>

<p>Mr. West, attacked by his enemy the gout, was now
a prisoner at Wickham. On January 24, in a long letter,
these paragraphs are of interest—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The joyous Berenger passed five days with us last
week, read to us a play in Shakespeare and the <cite>‘Volpone’
of B. Johnson</cite>, and repeated innumerable scraps
out of a hundred others, laughed a great deal, said many
droll and some witty things, and then disappear’d, after
promising to come frequently to strut upon the little
stage of Wickham, which you may perceive has been
lately graced with almost as great a variety of characters
as are exhibited at Drury Lane, so that we have
little occasion to run to the great city in search of
company, much less for the sake of society, which indeed
there is almost lost, in the various bustle of Resort,
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_25">[25]</span>the busy hum of Men, the embarrassments of Hoops,—Interruptions
of Messages and ostentatious dinners and
Drums, Trumpets, Politics, etc., etc.,—but besides the
pleasures of social converse, we have had amusements of
a stiller kind furnished by the obliging civility of some of
my brother Authors; among which are two new papers,
‘<cite>The Adventurer</cite>’ and ‘<cite>The World</cite>,’<a id="2_FNanchor_39" href="#2_Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> by Adam Fitz-Adam.
The writer of the former sent me the first 14
numbers with a very handsome letter. To the other I
had indeed a kind of right since I am inform’d that the
judicious Tasters of the Town have declared it to be
written by Sir G(eorge) L(yttelton), by Mr. Pitt, or
your humble servant; with how much sagacity this
opinion is form’d I shall leave you to judge, for I doubt
not but this character will recommend them to your
perusal, as it precludes me saying anything in their
favour: of the former I may be so free as to declare I
like them very well, but I will be still bolder in recommending
to you <cite>Dr. Leland’s ‘Observations of Lord
Bolingbroke’s letter,’</cite> which was sent me by the author
yesterday, and which I have read through with great
pleasure and edification. I must transcribe a part of my
boy’s<a id="2_FNanchor_40" href="#2_Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> letter about the death of the Bishop of Cloyne:
‘We have had a great loss at Oxford; the poor Bishop
of Cloyne died on Sunday about 8 o’clock in the
evening. Mrs. Berkeley<a id="2_FNanchor_41" href="#2_Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> was sitting by him, and spoke
to him several times, and he never answered, so it is
supposed he was dead a quarter of an hour before it
was discovered, for he died without a groan or any sign
of pain.’</p>

<p>“He has received Rollin, for which I thank you in
his name.”</p>

<p>“How happy was the Bishop of Cloyne’s exit, or

departure out of this life, for it had none of the agonising
pangs of farewell. I pity poor Mrs. Berkeley, who had
so little preparation for so heavy a stroke. I hope the
constant conversation and example of a man so eminent
in every Christian virtue may have given her an uncommon
degree of fortitude and patience. I have heard
her temper and understanding highly commended. She
had a perfect adoration of the Bishop.... Dr. Berkeley
had formerly made his addresses to Mrs. Donnellan:
what were her reasons for refusing him I know not,
friends were consenting, circumstances equal, her opinion
captivated, but perhaps aversion to the cares of a
married life, and apprehensions from some particularities
in his temper hinder’d the match; however their friendship
always continued, and I have always heard her
give him for virtues and talents the preference to all
mankind.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE VAPOURS</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu continues that she had neither health
nor spirits to read with pleasure. “The misfortunes I
have suffered and those I have feared have worn me out;
after the various turns of hope and fear on my poor
Lydia’s account, I am at last in despair about her. Mr.
Botham sent to us for a milch ass for her some days
ago.” After a long lamentation on Lydia’s behalf, she
ends, “I am that poor little selfish animal, a human
creature, made more poor, more little, more selfish
by the Vapours; in all Sir Hans’ Museum there is
not so ugly a monster as a woman in Vapours.” Lydia
becoming worse, Mrs. Montagu wrote to inform her
sister, Mrs. Laurence Sterne, whose curious letter I
give in full as a specimen of her style. Both she
and her sister Lydia wrote large, legible hands, much
alike.</p>

“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>“I return you my sincere and hearty thanks for
the Favour of your most welcome letter; which had I received
in a more happy Hour, wou’d have made me almost
Frantick with Joy; for being thus cruelly separated
from all my Friends, the least mark of their kindness
towards me, or Remembrance of me gives me unspeakable
Delight. But the Dismal Account I receiv’d at the
same time of my poor Sister, has render’d my Heart
Incapable of Joy, nor can I ever know Comfort till I
hear of her Recovery.</p>

<p>“Believe me, Dear Madam, you were never more
mistaken than when you imagine that Time and Absence
remove you from my Remembrance. I do assure you I
do not so easily part with what affords me so great Delight,
on the Contrary I spare no pains to improve every
little accident that recalls you to my Remembrance, as
the only amends which can be made me for those Unhappinesses
my Situation deprives me of. As a proof
of this I must inform you that about three weeks ago I
took a long Ride Through very bad weather, and worse
Roads, merely for the satisfaction of enjoying a Conversation
with a Gentleman who though unknown to
you had conceiv’d the highest opinion of you from the
perusal of several of your Letters, for which he was indebted
to Mrs. Clayton. Had this Gentleman nothing
else to recommend him, it certainly would be Sufficient
to have made me desirous of his acquaintance; but he
is both a Man of Sense and good Breeding, so that I am
not a little pleas’d with my new Acquaintance. Your
Supposition of my Sister’s having Boasted to me of her
Children is doubtless extremely Natural, I wish it had
been as Just: But I can in three words inform you of
all I know about ’em,—to wit their number and their
Names, for which I am indebted to Johnny. Had my
Lydia been so obliging as to have made them the<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_28">[28]</span>
Subject of her Letters, I shou’d by this time have had a
tolerable Idea of them, by considering what she said
with some abatement: but as it is I no more know
whether they are Black, Brown or Fair, Wise, or other
wise, Gentle, or Froward than the Man in the Moon.
Pray is this strange Silence on so Interesting a Subject
owing to her profound Wisdom or her abundant Politeness?
But be it to which it will, as soon as she recovers
her Health I shall insist on all the satisfaction she can
give on this head. In the meantime I rejoice to find
they have your approbation and am truly thankful that
Nature has done her part, which indeed is the most
Material, though I frankly own I shall not be the first
to Forgive any slights that Dame Fortune may be dispos’d
to shew them.</p>

<p>“Your god-Daughter, as in Duty bound, sends her
best Respects to you. I will hope that she may enjoy
what her poor Mother in vain Laments, the want of a
more intimate acquaintance with her Kindred.</p>

<p>The godchild was Lydia Sterne, born December 1,
1747, then in her sixth year. The Sternes had lost their
first child, also a <i>Lydia</i>, born in October, 1745.</p>

<p>Lydia Botham did not long survive; I do not know
the exact day of her death, but West, writing on
April 2, to Mrs. Montagu, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I cannot conclude without thanking you, my dearest
Cousin, for informing me of your health, about which I
should have been under great alarms upon hearing of
Lydia’s Death, of which your letter brought me the first
intelligence. This kind attention to my happiness at a
time when your heart was overflowing with sorrow is<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_29">[29]</span>
such a proof of your regard for me I shall always
remember with gratitude.”</p>
</div>

<p>Though deeply lamented, Lydia’s sufferings, latterly
from asthma, dropsy, and a complication of disorders,
made her death more or less a release. Mr. Botham
was now left a widower with five children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LADY BATH’S ASSEMBLY</div>

<p>Writing from London, the end of April, to Sarah
Scott in John Street, Bath, where she and Lady Bab
were living, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been at Oratorios so crowded and plays so
hot I have almost fainted, but first of all crowds and
greatest of all mobs, I must in justice name Lady
Bath’s<a id="2_FNanchor_43" href="#2_Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> assembly, from whence at hazard of life and limb
I broke away a little after one on Tuesday last. Her
ladyship had happily gathered together eight hundred
Christian souls, many of which had like to have perished
by famine and other accidents. I suffered the most
from the first of these; being ill, I had not eat a morsel
of dinner, and there was not a biscuit nor a bit of bread
to be got, and half the company got out through the
stables and garden. The house was not empty till near
3 in the morning.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu had for some time been expecting
Miss Carter, the young daughter of Mr. Montagu’s
faithful agent, to stay with her. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My little disciple<a id="2_FNanchor_44" href="#2_Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> is very good, and takes to me
wondrous well. I expect the eldest Miss Botham next
week, you may suppose it was some denial not to
choose the second, but I thought the other my duty
rather, and the eldest would have been much grieved
to be passed over.”</p>

<p>Writing to Mr. Montagu (who had gone to Sandleford
on business, and to cure a bad cold) on May 3, his
wife describes a Rout she had given. “I had rather
more than an hundred visitants last night, but the
apartment held them with ease, and the highest compliments
were paid to the house and elegance of the
apartments.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“A PERFECT WOMAN”</div>

<p>Gilbert West from Wickham, on May 23, gives the
following account of Mr. Pitt, whose health had been
causing much anxiety to his friends—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Had I answered your letter last night I should
have given you a good account of Mr. Pitt, who was
yesterday in better spirits than I have seen him in since
he came hither, but I find by inquiring after him this
morning that he has had a bad, that is, a sleepless night,
which has such effect on his spirits that I am afraid we
shall see him in a very different condition to-day. This
has happened to him every other night since Friday
last, so I am persuaded there is something intermitting
in his case, of which neither the Physicians nor himself
seem to be aware. I think he ought to go to town to
consult with them, but to this he has so great an aversion
that I question if he will comply with our request. Sir
George Lyttelton, who saw him on one of his bad days,
Saturday last, promised to come hither to-day, and his
voice added to ours may possibly prevail....</p>

<p>“Mr. Pitt express’d a due sense of your goodness
in inquiring so particularly after him, and that you may
know how high you stand in his opinion, I must inform
you that in a conversation with Molly he pronounced
you the most <i>perfect woman</i> he ever met with.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">MR. PITT’S INSOMNIA</div>

<p>Mr. Pitt was recommended by his doctors to go to
Tunbridge Wells to drink the waters. Accompanied
by Mr. West, Mrs. West, and Miss West, he set off
on May 26. West, writing to Mrs. Montagu, says—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_31">[31]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">
“Tunbridge Wells, May 27, 1753.</p>
<p class="greet5">“<span class="smcap">My dearest Cousin! My best and most valuable
Friend!</span></p>

<p>“Your kind letter which I received on coming
from Chapel is the most agreeable thing I have met
with at Tunbridge, where we arrived last night about 7,
after only stopping at Sen’nocks, and dining at Tunbridge
Town. It came very seasonably to relieve my
spirits which were much sunk by the extreme dejection
which appears to-day in Mr. Pitt, from a night passed
entirely without sleep, notwithstanding all the precautions
which were taken within doors to make it
still and quiet, and the accidental tranquillity arising
from the present emptiness and desolation of this place,
to which no other invalids, except ourselves are yet
arrived, or even expected to arrive as yet. He began to
drink the waters to-day, but as they are sometimes very
slow in their operations, I much fear both he and those
friends who cannot help sympathizing with him, will
suffer a great deal before the wished-for effect will take
place, for this <i>Insomnium</i> his Physicians have prescribed
Opiates, a medicine which, in this case, though they may
procure a temporary ease, yet often after recoil upon
the spirits. He seems inclined to take Musk, and intends
to talk with Molly about it. I think his Physicians have
been to blame in giving all their attention to the disorder
in his bowels, and not sufficiently regarding the Distemperature
of his spirits, a Disease much more to be
apprehended than the other; while he continues under
this Oppression, I am afraid it will be impossible for me
to leave him, as he fancies me of the greatest use to him
as a friend, and a comforter, but I hope in God he will
soon find some alteration for the better, of which I shall
be glad to give you the earliest information. In the
meantime I beg you will take care of your health, and
as the most effectual means of establishing it, I most
earnestly desire you will follow Mr. Montagu’s exhortations
to repair forthwith to Tunbridge, as by so doing
you will not only contribute to the regaining your own
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_32">[32]</span>health, but to the comfort and felicity of some here who
love you.... Kitty, Molly and Mr. Pitt desire their
affectionate compliments. Molly begs you will communicate
this account of Mr. Pitt to Sir G(eorge)
L(yttelton).”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">RENT OF LODGINGS</div>

<p>In West’s next letter, of May 30, he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I think Mr. Pitt is somewhat better, tho’ his spirits
are too low to allow him to think so, and his nights are
still sleepless without the aid of Opiates. I write this
from the ‘Stone House’ to which we were driven by
the noisy situation of our house at the foot of Mount
Sion. How many pleasing ideas our present habitation
recalls I leave you to judge, though there needs
no such artificial helps to make you ever present to my
memory.... Mr. Pitt is lodged in your room, and I
in that which was Mr. Montagu’s dressing-room on the
ground floor.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Montagus and Wests together had rented the
“Stone House” the year before this. On May 31 West
writes to say he is leaving Mr. William Lyttelton with
Mr. Pitt, and will return to Wickham on Saturday, and
dine with Mrs. Montagu at Hayes <i>en route</i>. He adds,
“Mr. Pitt feels a little gout in his foot, which we hope
will increase so as to be an effectual Remedy for all
his disorders.”</p>

<p>On June 6, West, who had been commissioned to
find a house for Mrs. Montagu, looks at the last two left
on Mount Ephraim, a Mr. Spooner’s and a Mr. Sele’s;
he decided on the latter, orders the chimney to be made
higher, and a <i>hovel</i> put on it to stop smoking, and to
order the owners to lie in the beds to air them!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The price he told me was 4 guineas a week, or
thirty-five guineas for the whole season, that is till
Michaelmas, or a week or two over; for this price you
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_33">[33]</span>are to have stabling for eight horses, and a coach house
for two carriages.... Mrs. West will be obliged to you
if you will bring her jewels with you.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu arrived at Tunbridge on June 11, and
on the 13th writes to her husband, then in London,
to say</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“my cough is much abated, and my appetite increased:
the asses’ milk sits well on my stomach.... I have
a constant invitation to dinner at the ‘White House’;
Mr. Pitt is too ill to dine abroad, and the Wests
cannot leave him, so as often as I am disposed for
company, I dine there; the rest of my time passes in
taking air and exercise, and now and then the relief of
a book.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CANVASSING</div>

<p>On account of the Jew Bill and other unpopular
measures coming before Parliament, a General Election
was anticipated, and Lord Sandwich was already arranging
for it by canvassing his constituents, and those
at Huntingdon, and summoned Mr. Montagu to meet him
at Hinchinbrooke the second week in August. Previous
to this he spent a few days with his wife at Tunbridge
hence proceeding to Yorkshire for his annual estate
business. Old Mr. Robinson accompanied his friend,
Sir Edward Dering, to canvass for him in Kent, and his
daughter says, “My Father would have made a good
counterpart to Sir Edward Dering; if <i>bon mots</i> could
carry a county, I know few that would care to contend
with them.”</p>

<p>Previous to going to Tunbridge, Mrs. Montagu
placed her two young charges, Miss Carter and Miss
Botham, in a boarding-school. She writes to her sister
Sarah—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_34">[34]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Montagu thought Miss Carter’s dancing would
be better improved if she went to School, and he is as
desirous she should be a fine dancer as if she was to be
a Maid of Honour. I was the more willing in regard to
Miss Botham going, for my cousin is of such a ‘diversian’
temper, as Cotes used to express it, that I feared she
would not be easily restrained in a place of this sort;
she is a fine girl, but so lively and so idle, she requires
infinite care. With great capacity of learning she has
prodigious desire to be idle, and thinks it quite hard
not to take her share of all the diversions she hears of.
On being asked how she liked London she said very
well, but should do so much better if she was to go to
Ranelagh every night! I have left them at a very good
school, but an expensive one; however, they are only
to stay there till the 15th of August, for then the school
breaks up, and if I do not leave this place sooner, they
must come. I believe no gouvernante ever took half
the pains I have done with these children, explaining to
them everything they read, and talking to them on all
points of behaviour.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">PENSHURST</div>

<p>On July 4, in a letter to Mr. Montagu, who was at
Theakstone, his wife writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All the family at the ‘Stone House’ and myself in
their train went yesterday to Penshurst; we spent a
good deal of time in viewing the pictures. I was most
pleased with the portraits, as I know not any family
that for Arts and Arms, greatness of courage and
nobility of mind have excelled the Sydney Race. Beauty
too, has been remarkable in it.”</p>
</div>

<p>And on July 8—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has been much the turn of the Society I am in to
go out in parties to see places, and last post day we
settled upon an expedition of this sort with such precipitation,
I had not opportunity to write without keeping
the company waiting. We went to see an old seat<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_35">[35]</span>
of a Mr. Brown’s; it is well situated, was built by Inigo
Jones, has some fine portraits.... We went from this
venerable seat to a place called New Vauxhall, where
Mr. Pitt had provided us a good dinner; the view from
it is romantic; we staid there till the cool of the evening,
and then returned home. We drank tea yesterday
in the most beautiful rural scene that can be imagined,
which Mr. Pitt had discovered in his morning’s ride
about half a mile from hence; he ordered a tent to be
pitched, tea to be prepared, and his French horn to
breathe music like the unseen genius of the wood:
the company dined with me, and we set out, number 8....
Sir George Lyttelton and Mr. Bower are come to
spend a few days with Mr. Pitt.”</p>
</div>

<p>To this her husband replies, “I very much approve
of the excursions you make, and think the more the
better, as they both entertain the mind and give
exercise to the body.” He adds, the epidemic then
raging amongst cattle in England had not been so
severe on his northern property as in other parts of the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRINITY COLLEGE LIBRARY</div>

<p>Mr. Pitt went to Hastings for two days, and on his
return, Mr. West made a tour to Canterbury, Dover,
etc., which lasted five days. Dr. Smith,<a id="2_FNanchor_45" href="#2_Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Mr. Montagu’s
old friend, was then at Tunbridge, and Mrs. Montagu
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We fell into discourse upon some embellishments
and ornaments to be added to the fine Library at Trinity
College. There are to be 26 Bustos put up, 13 in
memory of the ancients, 13 of modern, these are to
be cast in plaister of Paris: but Mrs. Middleton talks of
a fine Marble Busto of Dr. Middleton to be done by
Roubilliac,<a id="2_FNanchor_46" href="#2_Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which I think very proper, as he was so<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_36">[36]</span>

as he was long Librarian it is proper it should be in

persons that have been of the College.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIBSIDE</div>

<p>After seeing to the business consequent on his
trusteeship to his cousin, Mr. Rogers, of Newcastle,
Mr. Montagu had returned to Theakstone on July 29.
He describes Gibside, the seat of Mr. Bowes<a id="2_FNanchor_48" href="#2_Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I dined this day sennight at Gibside; it was one of
the finest summer days I ever saw. It set off to great
advantage the whole vale through which the river Tyne
runs, which consists of a great deal of good rich land.
The Moors, tho’ not so pleasing to the eye, make abundant
amends by the riches of the mines. All the gentlemen
are planting and adorning their Seats, but nothing
comes up to the grandeur and magnificence of what Mr.
Bowes has done, and is a (<i>sic</i>), doing, I mean without
doors, for his house is but an indifferent one. It stands
in the midst of a great wood of about 400 acres, through
which there are a great many noble walks and rides
interspers’d with fine lawns, with a rough river running
thro’ it, on each side of which are very high rocks, which
gives it a very romantick look. Mr. Bowes is at present<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_37">[37]</span>
upon a work of great magnificence, which is the erecting
a column of above 140 feet high. This, as far as I
know, may be the largest that ever was erected by a
subject in this Island, and may yield to nothing but the
Monument at London. I ought not to omit telling you
that he has already erected upon a rising ground a
gothick building which he calls a Banquetting room,
in which the night before there was a concert of Musick
(<i>sic</i>), at which Jordain and an Italian woman performed,
whom Mrs. Lane<a id="2_FNanchor_49" href="#2_Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> brought with her from Bramham
Moor, from which she came in a day.... On Monday
I dined with Sir Thomas Clavering.<a id="2_FNanchor_50" href="#2_Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This gentleman’s
house is very old and bad, but the situation good and
prospect pleasant. He has made a long road leading to
his house and improved his park, and made a serpentine
river.... He has also, as well as all the other gentlemen
in that county, made a kitchen garden with very
high walls, planted with the finest fruit trees. I question
not peaches and nectarines may succeed very well,
but for grapes they must be beholden to fire.”</p>

<p>From this it would appear that walled kitchen
gardens were new things in the North then; probably
“Kail yards” reigned supreme. Miss Carter and Miss

their school. Another excursion to Stonelands<a id="2_FNanchor_51" href="#2_Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> with
Mr. Pitt took place, and in a letter to Mr. Montagu on
August 3 we learn—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This dry Summer has been so favourable to the
Waters that they have made several surprising cures.
I think Mr. Pitt may be numbered amongst them. The
first time I saw the Duke of Bolton,<a id="2_FNanchor_52" href="#2_Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> I could hardly<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_38">[38]</span>

<div class="sidenote">“MINOUETS”</div>

<p>In the afternoons Mrs. Montagu and Mr. Pitt were
attending Mr. King’s lectures on philosophy, etc., and
“Mr. Pitt, who is desirous of attaining some knowledge
in this way, makes him explain things very precisely.”
In another letter she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Miss Carter will excell in dancing. I did not think
it right she should dance Minouets at the ball till she
was quite perfect in it, but Mr. West, Mr. Pitt and all
their family and some other company were here the
other day, and I made her dance a Minouet with Master
West by way of using her to do it in company; she
acquitted herself so well as to get great commendation.”</p>
</div>

<p>As usual, the husband and wife exchanged loving
letters on the anniversary of their wedding-day,
August 5. Mrs. Montagu mentions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is a report that Lord Coke is dying; his
wife, Lady Mary, is here; she is extremely pretty, her
air and figure the most pleasing I ever saw. She is
not properly a beauty, but she has more <i>agrémens</i> than
one shall often see. With so many advantages of birth,
person and fortune, I do not wonder at her resentment
being lively, and that she could ill brook the neglects
and insults of her husband.”</p>

by Horace Walpole. Her husband treated her with
great brutality, and she gained a separation from him.

<p>Mr. Herbert is mentioned as being very ill at Tunbridge;
this was the uncle of the 6th Earl of Carnarvon,<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_39">[39]</span>
of Highclere Castle, Hants. Mr. Montagu says, “He
has done a great deal to adorn and beautify Highclere;

<p class="from s9">“Sandleford, September 27, 1753.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">My most honoured Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“Your kind and agreeable letter restored me in
some measure to the temper I lost at going out of town
the very day you came to it. I know not what poets
may find in the country, when they have filled the woods
with sylvan Deities, and the rivers with Naides; but to
me groves and streams and plains make poor amends
for the loss of a friend’s conversation. You have better
supplied Mr. Pitt’s absence by reading the Orations of
his predecessor, Demosthenes, and I can easily imagine
you would rather have passed the evening with the
British than the Grecian Demosthenes, whom in talents
perhaps he equals, and in grace of manners and the
sweet civilities of life, I dare say he excels. But when
you seem to say you would even have preferred the
simple small talk of your poor cousin to the Athenian
Orator, I cry out,—Oh wondrous power of friendship,
which like the sun gives glorious colours to a vapour,
and brightens the pebble to a gem, till what would have
been neglected by the common herd is accepted by the
most distinguished.... On Tuesday morning about
eight o’clock I called upon Mr. Hooke at his hermitage.
I found him like a true Savant surrounded by all the
elements of Science, but though I roamed round the
room, I could not perceive any signs of the Author,
no papers, pen, ink, or sheets just come from the press.
I fear the fine ladies and fine prospects of Cookham
divert his attention from the Roman History.... I<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_42">[42]</span>
desired him to carry me to Mrs. Edwin’s, which I heard
was a pretty place.<a id="2_FNanchor_56" href="#2_Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> There is an old ferry woman who
crosses the Thames very often before Mrs. Edwin’s
terrace.... While we were in Mrs. Edwin’s garden he
betrayed my name to her ... she came down, showed
me her house and the pictures, which are very fine, but
the views from her windows gave one no leisure to
consider the works of art.... Cliefden Hill rises
majestically in view, and the only flat shore you see
from this place lies straight before it, and is a large
plain of the finest verdure and full of cattle.”</p>

<p>To this letter Gilbert West replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am glad your journey to Sandleford was relieved
by the agreeable digression you made to Cookham,
where I hope to find, at least in the memory of Mr.
Hooke, the vestiges of your having been there, which
will be an additional motive to me to make him a visit
from Stoke, for I am going once more from Wickham,
notwithstanding the neighbourhood of Sir Thomas

of my Urn, which is to come this very day, and which
Mr. Cheer hath taught me to consider as an emblem and
monument of the polished, elegant and accomplished
Mrs. Montagu, by assuring me ‘that it is indebted for all
the extraordinary and highly finished ornaments he hath
bestowed upon it, to the great regard and veneration he
hath for her, and that he will not either for love or money
make such another.’ ... I was paying a visit at Fulham,
where I enjoyed the smiles of my beloved Bishop,<a id="2_FNanchor_59" href="#2_Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the
presence of Mrs. Sherlock, and the agreeable conversation
of Mrs. Chester, with the more substantial delicacies
of an excellent English Venison Pasty.”</p>

to see his mother, Lady Langham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW POST-CHAISE</div>

<p>In the next letter (Oct. 3) from Sandleford to Mr.
West occurs this sentence, “Mr. Montagu returned
hither on Monday with the new four-wheeled post-chaise;
it is the pleasantest machine imaginable in
rough roads, but I think it too easy on even roads.”
The coachmen had nothing intermediate between the
two-wheeled vehicles and the ponderously long six-
or four-horsed coach, which required elaborate skill in
turning.</p>

<p>Staying again at Fulham, Mr. West mentions that
he has been urging Bishop Sherlock to publish some
of his sermons, which he promised to do. West had
a fresh attack of the gout, which made him return
home. Mr. Pitt had left Hayes suddenly for Bath,
Tunbridge waters not having been of sufficient use to
him; and in a letter of October 13, to West, in capital
letters, her inquiries not being answered, Mrs. Montagu
asks, “I desire <span class="allsmcap">TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD
CONCERNING MR. PITT’S HEALTH</span>?” Describing her daily
life, she says she keeps up the Tunbridge habit of
driving an hour or so after dinner (which, it must be
remembered, was then early) over the adjacent common;
after these airings she drank tea, and retired to her
dressing-room for two or three hours of reading.</p>

<p>On October 14 West writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Duke and Duchess of Portland, with two of
their daughters, dined here last Thursday, and we are
to make them a morning’s visit to-morrow at Bullstrode.
Her Grace was extremely courteous and obliging to me,
but never made any inquiry after you, which piqued me
so much, that I put her against her upon talking about
Mr. Botham, and from what she said about the distrest
situation of his family, took occasion to extol you as the<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_44">[44]</span>
most generous and sincere friend, and indeed the only
one the poor man could depend on.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">LADY BUTE</div>

<p>The reader will have doubtless missed the frequent
mention of the duchess and her letters. There is no
doubt that the coolness between the quondam intimate
friends was on account of the Scott separation. It will
be remembered the duchess sided with Mrs. Scott’s
engagement against Mrs. Montagu’s opinion. After the
Scott separation, probably influenced by her intimate
friend, Lady Bute, who with the Princess of Wales
seems to have defended him,<a id="2_FNanchor_60" href="#2_Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the duchess appears to
have taken his part; but his true character is shown
by the fact that the Prince of Wales (George <abbr title="the Third"><abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr></abbr>), on
being given a Household in 1756, begged that Scott<a id="2_FNanchor_61" href="#2_Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
should not be continued about him, and to make up
for this dismissal he was given a commissionership in
the Excise. Later on the duchess and Mrs. Montagu
had a <i>rapprochement</i>, but the letters were never as
cordial as in previous times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BULLSTRODE MENAGERIE</div>

<p>Writing from Lillingston on October 27, West describes
his visit to Bullstrode—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was very kindly received both at Bullstrode and
Cookham; at the former we were shown a great many
fine and great many curious things, both in doors and
without; the day proved too cold, and I was not enough
recovered to see all the rarities of the animal as well as
the vegetable kind, which were dispersed over the Park
and gardens. Those that might be seen from the windows,
as some spotted Sheep and a little Bull from Fort
St. David’s, whose resemblance I have often seen in
China ware, I beheld with admiration and applause, and
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_45">[45]</span>ventured two steps into the garden to take a view of the
orange trees against the wall.... Her Grace promised
to make me a present of some trained up for that purpose.
In her closet we were shown some curious works
in Shells, performed by Mrs. Delany, whom her Grace
expected at Bullstrode in a short time, and expressed
great pleasure and not a little impatience in the prospect
of seeing so dear and so ingenious a friend. Of you she
said nothing, till upon her naming Mrs. Donnellan, I
said I could give her some account of her, having been
informed by you that she was gone to town; she then
asked when I heard from you, and where you was, but
carried her enquiry after you no further. At Cookham
I spent some hours with Mrs. Stanley, for Mr. Hooke
had gone out with Mrs. Edwin to make a visit to Dr.
Freind....” He further states that he found his
mother well, and “very little alter’d since I last saw
her, excepting that she has grown a little fatter, a
circumstance to a woman of seventy is greatly preferable
to wrinkles. In my way thro’ Stowe Park I met
Miss Banks riding out with Lord Vere,<a id="2_FNanchor_62" href="#2_Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> of her I
enquired much about Mr. Pitt, and received from her
the same answer, which I must have made for your
enquiries after him, that they had heard nothing of him
since he left Stowe.... While he staid at Stowe he
was in good health and spirits, he went from thence
to Hagley, and she believed he intended to go from
Hagley to Bath.”</p>

<p>On November 10 Mrs. Donnellan, to whom Mrs.
Montagu had lent her house in Hill Street, whilst she
searched for lodgings in the suburbs, her lungs not
permitting her to live in the town during the winter,
writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have taken a little house on tryal at Kensington

it is not formed on your plan of banishing delicacy. I
am afraid it carrys it too far on t’other side, and is too
fine spun, but there are fine things and fine characters
in it, and I don’t know how it is, but his tediousness
gives one an eagerness to go on; there is a love-sick
madness that I think extremely fine and touching, but
if you have not read it I must not forestall. I think I
will own to you, the great fault of my friend’s writings,
there is too much of everything. I really laughed at
your nursery of ‘Clarissas,’ but I hope you did not think
of me as the old nurse, there was nobody there while I
stayed!”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">“SIR CHARLES GRANDISON”</div>

<p>Mr. Richardson had just completed his novel of
Sir Charles Grandison. The Clarissas is an allusion
to Miss Botham and Miss Carter, then with Mrs.
Montagu.</p>

<p>This same month Mrs. Montagu was again very
unwell. West urged her to go to London, but Mr.
Montagu, who loved the retirement at Sandleford, was
unwilling to leave it, and she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tho’ I am told I may go to town, I know it would
not be agreeable where I ought to please, and I can
hardly think it right to be in such haste to quit the place
where I live most in the manner I ought to do, where
only I am useful. I relieve the distresses and animate
the industry of a few, and have given all my hours to
the two girls under my care, whose welfare, whose
eternal welfare perhaps, depends on what they shall
now learn.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Hooke and Mr. Botham were both at Sandleford.
In Mr. Hooke’s conversation Mrs. Montagu found much
enjoyment; as West put it, “He (Hooke) is a very
worthy man, and has in him the greatest compass of<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_47">[47]</span>
entertainments of any one I know, from nonsense (as
Lord Bath calls it), to sense, and beyond sense to
Metaphysics.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE TRIUMPHS OF THE GOUT”</div>

<p>On December 20 Mrs. West writes to present her
Christmas wishes, and Mr. West’s, to the Montagus, as
“Tubby” (Mr. West), as was his uneuphonious family
nickname, had the gout in both hands. Mrs. Montagu

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“The 27th of December, 1753.<br>

Corporations, or pilfer’d lottery tickets, clean even
from perquisite in office, and the most modest means by
which the Miser’s palm wooes and sollicits gain. So far
have your hands been from grasping at other’s gold,
they have not held fast your own with a tenacious grip,
but open’d liberally at the petitions of the poor, for the
productions of Art, or to feast your friends at the genial
board. Most of all do I resent the fate of the writing
hand, which was first dedicated to the Muses, then with
maturer judgment consecrated to the Nymphs of Solyma,
and shall it be led captive by the cruel gout? Why did
you sing the triumphs<a id="2_FNanchor_63" href="#2_Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> of the dire goddess? Oh, why

<div class="sidenote">MR. PELHAM’S DEATH</div>

<p>In the beginning of March in this year Mr. Pelham,
the Premier, died suddenly, and there was a General
Election. Mr. Pelham’s brother, the Duke of Newcastle,
was appointed first Lord of the Treasury; Mr. Legge,
Mr. Botham’s uncle, Chancellor of the Exchequer; Sir
George Lyttelton, Cofferer. Mr. Montagu proceeded
to Hinchinbrooke early in April to canvass, and his
wife writes to him on the 11th—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I hope you had a pleasant journey, and arrived
without fatigue. You are proceeding quietly and well
at Huntingdon, while many are hustling with infinite
animosity in other Boroughs. The votes are eleven
hundred paid a piece at Bury as I am informed....
Morris is very busy with the Canterbury Voters, he
does not like them so well as law Clients.”</p>
</div>

<p>Morris was canvassing for his elder brother Matthew,
of Horton.</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu writes on April 16 to say, “Yesterday
our Election came on, and was, I believe, one of the most
quiet and peaceable that ever was.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ELECTION</div>

<p>In her next letter to her husband she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have had a letter to-day from my brother
Robinson, informing me that he is chosen along with<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_50">[50]</span>
Creed; Mr. Best declined the Poll. My brother has
carried his Election without expence.... I cannot take
leave of you without expressing my pride and satisfaction
in seeing you again enter the House of Commons,
where you have behaved with such steadiness and integrity.
I have a joy and pride whenever I reflect on
any part of your moral character. May your virtues
meet with the happiness they deserve!”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">“TOM” LYTTELTON</div>

<p>Bower writes to Mrs. Montagu on April 16 from
Oakhampton, where he had gone with Sir George
Lyttelton for his election, in fervid Italian. He was
disgusted at the orgy of the election, and says that at
the election dinner given by the mayor and magistrates
in their robes to Sir George Lyttelton, they sat down
at 3 o’clock p.m., and none rose to leave till two in the
morning! “<span lang="it">e tutti, o quasi tutti partirono cordialmente ubbriachi</span>”
(“and all, <i>nearly</i> all, parted thoroughly drunk”).
He continues, “The cavaliers then went from house to
house to kiss the ladies, as was customary, and ask for
the votes of their husbands.” After fervid speeches made
to the “celeste imagine della Madonna del Monte e
della Strada del Monte” (the celestial image of the
Madonna of the Mount and the Madonna of Hill Street),
meaning Mrs. Montagu, his pen is taken up by Lyttelton,
who says, “The Italian language affords such lofty expressions,
as the poverty of ours will not come up to,
and therefore the Madonna must be content with my
telling her that the good Father with all his Devotion
does not honour her more than I do....” At the
end of his letter he says, “I hear from my wife that
my Boy has been with you: a thousand thanks for your
goodness to him.” This is the first mention of Thomas,
afterwards 2nd Baron Lyttelton, then only ten years
old. Lyttelton had early besought the interest and influence
of Mrs. Montagu for his son and daughter by<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_51">[51]</span>
his first marriage. Both became truly attached to her,
would that her influence had prevailed on “Tom” later
in life.</p>

<p>At this period Mrs. Donnellan was very ill, and Mrs.
Montagu did her best to nurse her. Lady Sandwich
came to town to inoculate her daughter, Lady Mary.
Miss Mary Pitt had been to see Mrs. Montagu, and “she
assures me Mr. Pitt is in good health, but has had another
attack of gout in his hand, owing, ’tis imagined, to his
being blooded for a sore throat.”</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu at this period sustained the heavy loss
of his faithful agent, the second Mr. Carter, who died at
Theakstone, and whose loss necessitated his immediate
journey to the north to attend to his own and Mr.
Rogers’ affairs, all of which had been confided to Mr.
Carter’s care. Taking Mr. Botham as his temporary
secretary and companion, they started off northward by
post-chaises, a most expensive process, as Mr. Montagu
called it. On June 13 Mrs. Montagu writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am sorry Mrs. Carter (the grandmother), has set
her heart so much on having her granddaughter with
her, she is of the proper age to receive instruction and
take impressions; a few years passed innocently will
not leave her as amiable a subject as she is now, her
mind will be less flexible.... Mr. Pitt drank tea with
me this afternoon; he has recovered his health entirely,
if one may judge by his looks. He tells me he has built
a very good house at Bath for £1200. He mention’d to
me his intention of going on Saturday to Wickham to
propose the place at Chelsea to Mr. West, the offer will
certainly be an agreeable one.”</p>
</div>

<p>This place was that of the paymaster to Chelsea
College. In the next letter to Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs.
Montagu says—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_52">[52]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The place is call’d a thousand pounds a year, it is
in the gift of Mr. Pitt, and was given with grace that few
know how to put into any action ... they have excellent
lodgings annexed to the place.... Mr. Pitt dined with
them on Saturday; I imagine he was very happy, but
he so well deserved to be so. It is a fine thing to act
the part of Providence and bless the good. Miss Carter
was sent for by her old grandmother, last week she
left me.”</p>
</div>

<p>Writing to her husband on June 15, Mrs. Montagu
states she shall be glad to hear as soon as Mr. Montagu
thinks he will return, “that I may disfurnish Hayes,
which I shall quit as a man does a homely but a quiet
wife, with some little regret, but not much tender
sorrow; it is not a beautiful place, but it is quiet, and
when one steps out of the bustle of Town, appears on
that account amiable.” She adds that her sister’s health
is greatly improved, and her temper less petulant, on
account of having taken to a milk and vegetable diet.</p>

<p>On July 9 Mrs. Montagu mentions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My brother Robinson came to town last night; he
dined here to-day, and we are all going to Vauxhall,
where Mr. Tyers has had the ruins of Palmyra painted
in the manner of the scenes so as to deceive the eye and
appear buildings.”</p>
</div>

<p>Her sister Sarah and brother Charles were with her.
She concludes with an affectionate appeal to her husband
not to apply himself too much to business at Newcastle,
but to take exercise for his health’s sake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. WEST’S APPOINTMENT — ELIZABETH CANNING</div>

<p>In another letter undated, but about this period, as it
mentions West’s thanks to Mr. Montagu for his congratulations
on his appointment to Chelsea Hospital,
allusion is made to Elizabeth Canning, whose curious
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_53">[53]</span>story of having been kidnapped<a id="2_FNanchor_64" href="#2_Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and ill-treated had
convulsed London opinion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The town is in great agitation about Elizabeth
Canning; she is condemn’d to Transportation, but her
guilt is so far from appearing certain, that the Sheriffs
refuse to conduct her among the other felons. All the
Aldermen but Sir Crispe Gascoigne<a id="2_FNanchor_65" href="#2_Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> petition in her
behalf, all the great officers of the State almost, interpose
for her, and the Archbishop of Canterbury also
desires that she may have a decent person of her own
sex to attend her over, and then to board in a private
family. Some fear there will be a rising of the Mob in
her favour; in general all seem to agree that the matter
is entirely doubtful. As to Sir Crispe Gascoigne he dare
not stir without being guarded.... I wish the whole
affair was brought to light, there is great iniquity
somewhere.”</p>

</div>

<p>On July 19, writing from Hayes, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Miss Mary Pitt, youngest sister of Mr. Pitt, is come
to stay a few days with me, she is a very sensible, modest,
pretty sort of young woman, and as Mr. Pitt seem’d to
take every civility shown to her as a favour, I thought
this mark of respect to her one manner of returning my
obligations to him.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu and Mr. Botham proceeded to Newcastle
to regulate Mr. Rogers’ affairs, which, as before
mentioned, required attention, owing to the death of
the head agent, Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>In consequence probably of worry, Mr. Montagu
returned from the north at the end of July with a fever,
“which,” as his wife writes to Sarah, “bleeding and
wormwood draughts have taken off,” and as soon as he
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_54">[54]</span>was fit he was to go with her to Hayes to pack up her
books. Miss Anstey was staying with them, and was
to accompany them to Sandleford. Mention is made
of a portrait of herself which Mrs. Montagu was going
to send Mrs. Scott: “Mr. Cambridge call’d on me the
other day, he spoke much in your praise. I told him
I hoped he would call on you at Bath, he promised he
would.” This was Richard Owen Cambridge,<a id="2_FNanchor_66" href="#2_Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> a friend
of Dr. Johnson, who wrote the “Scribbleriad.”</p>

<p>Writing to West from Sandleford of her neighbours
at Hayes, she regrets the society of Mrs. Herring and
the Archbishop,<a id="2_FNanchor_67" href="#2_Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and desires her regards to them. He
answers—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I made your compliments to the Archbishop and
Mrs. Herring, who dined with us the very day I received

<div class="sidenote">BRIGHTHELM&shy;STONE</div>

<p>At the beginning of September, through the influence
of West, the Bishop of London gave the living of Ealing
to Mr. Botham. Botham was at Brighthelmstone with
his two boys for sea-bathing, as they were not in health.
The joy of Mrs. Montagu was great at this preferment,
as the bishop permitted Mr. Botham to continue to hold
Albury as well, placing a curate in the living he did not
occupy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“PRECIEUSES RIDICULES”</div>

<p>Writing again to West, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Mangey kept a curate at Ealing as he did not
reside there, but undoubtedly Mr. Botham will discharge
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_55">[55]</span>the duties of the living he resides at without assistance;
the Bishop of London required Mr. Botham’s residence:
as the girls and boys are growing up and must soon live
with him, they will be better placed at Ealing in a good
neighbourhood than at Albury. They will learn nothing
there but eating and drinking plentifully of Lord Aylesford,
and Mr. Godschall’s house is generally full of
poetic Misses, who are addressing each other by the
names of Parthenia, Araminta, etc., with now and then
a little epistle to Strephon or Damon. I was uneasy
whenever they were at home, for fear they should enter
into the <i>precieuse</i> character of Mrs. Godschall.”</p>
</div>

<p>This style of conversation is taken off in <cite>Molière’s
“Precieuses Ridicules.”</cite></p>

<p>West’s mother, Lady Langham was now paying her
son a visit. Mrs. Montagu writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I think the vast territories of imagination could not
afford any view so pleasing as the meeting of such a son
and such a mother; the pictures not only pleased my
mind, but warm’d my heart ... that you may at Lady
Langham’s age be as well able to take a journey, and
your son as well deserve, and as joyfully receive such a
visit is my sincerest and most earnest wish ... another
pleasure attends you all, and which your benevolence
and not your pride will feel, that of setting an example of
those various charities, of parent, child, husband and wife,
which make the happiness of domestic life; and there is
surely more honour in filling well <i>the circle mark’d of
Heaven</i> in these spheres of relation, than in running the
wild career of Ambition in its most shining track.
Indeed there is no part of a conduct that so certainly
deserves our approbation as an acquittance of family
regards. Actions of a public nature often are inspired
by vanity, domestic behaviour has not popular applause
for its object, tho’ with the sober judgment, as Mr. Pope
says of silence, ‘<i>its very want of voice makes it a kind of
fame</i>.’”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_56">[56]</span></p>
<p>She then proceeds to thank West eloquently for
Botham’s presentation to <i>Kingston</i> (this must be a mistake
for Ealing), and ends with desiring some paper hangings
“she and Mrs. Isted had laboriously adorned” to be taken
down with care at her house at Hayes, but leaves the rest
of the hangings to the landlord. “I presume some
retail grocer, haberdasher of small wares, or perhaps a
tallow chandler, will shortly be in possession of my
Castle at Hayes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. HATELEY</div>

<p>At Sandleford were staying young Mr. Hateley, an
artist, and Miss Anstey. The latter being in treaty for a
house in London, accepted Mr. Montagu’s escort thither,
and Mr. Hateley wishing to accompany them a portion
of the way, mounted a horse, which flung him at the first
start off and grievously cut and bruised him. The
doctor was summoned after the departure of Mr. Montagu
and Miss Anstey, who “blooded him, and he was
ordered to take no food but balm tea lest he should
have a fever.... The Harvest Home Supper last night
was very jolly, the guests had as good appetite as those
who meet to eat Turtle,” writes Mrs. Montagu to her
husband on September 23.</p>

<p>Miss Anstey, having lost her parents, and Trumpington
having become her brother’s property, had determined
to live in London. She took Mr. Montagu to
help her in choosing a residence in Queen Street, a new-built
house for £800. Miss Anstey executed several
commissions for Mrs. Montagu, amongst which she
mentions, “I have sent several prints of Nun’s habits,
some one of which I hope may become the beautiful
Eloise, and I shall very much rejoice to hear she has
taken the Veil.”</p>

<p>Mention is made in a previous letter of Mrs.
Montagu’s of Hateley painting a picture of Eloise, but
who sat for it I cannot say. Hateley recovered from
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_57">[57]</span>his accident. A new post-chaise had been ordered for
the Montagus, and Mr. Montagu found it “nothing
showy or brilliant,” but his wife assures him, “I shall
find no fault with the plainness of the post-chaise,
neatness being all that is aimed at.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LILLINGSTON DAYRELL</div>

<p>West, writing on October 8 from Wickham, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have the honour to agree with my dearest and
most excellent cousin in looking upon writing letters as
one of the evils of Human Life, and for that reason I
have always declined engaging in a correspondence of
that kind with anybody but her, tho’ I was once invited
to it by the great Mr. Pope.... I am now turning my
thoughts towards Chelsea, where I hope to be settled
for the whole winter by the beginning of next month.

all her chickens at once under her wings, but she
will have them by turns.”</p>

Mrs. Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am impatient to wait on you; all the horses and

<div class="sidenote">BATH EASTON</div>

<p>Sarah Scott and Lady Bab Montagu had taken a
house at Bath Easton for use in the summer, and
desiring plants for the garden there, Mrs. Montagu
sends on November 6 to them a vast number of pinks,
roses and honeysuckles, together with a home-cured
ham. In the accompanying letter she mentions Ealing
being</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“two hundred pounds a year, his house a very pretty
one, a good garden with a great deal of wall fruit, and
there is a neighbourhood of genteel people, who have all

<div class="sidenote">“HISTORY OF BATH”</div>

<p>To this Sarah writes on November 17, to thank her
for the plants and to say she and Lady Barbara had
returned to Bath for the winter, Bath Easton being too
near the water for them. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Have I sent you word of a subscription making for
Nash? I believe it began since I wrote last. It is
entitled a subscription for a ‘History of Bath and
Tunbridge for these last 40 years,’ by Richard Nashe,
Esqre., with an Apology for the Author’s life. The
whole money, two guineas, is to be paid down at once,
for he does not pretend any book is to come out. Some
have subscribed 10 guineas, many five, and a great many
hundred pounds are already subscribed. It is to be
kept open for life, and people give to him who will not
part with a guinea to relieve the greatest real and unmerited
distress imaginable. The pretence is that he
has but little more than £200 a year, which is not supposed
true, but if it was, surely it is full equal to his
merits, whether one considers them as moral or entertaining.
To such ladies as have secret histories belonging
to them, he hints that he knows every one’s private life
and shall publish it. This place grows so full of subscriptions
that no person of moderate fortune will long
be able to come to it. The people of the rooms are
endeavouring to obtain a subscription of half a guinea
each man, and a crown each woman for the season. As
yet it has not been complied with, but they require
it with such insolence, that I make no doubt it will
be complied with. I shall be glad to hear you are
safely settled in Hill Street. I assure you the picture<a id="2_FNanchor_73" href="#2_Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>

<p>“Beau” Nash had reigned a despotic Master of the
Ceremonies over Bath for fifty years, living in a most
expensive style, mainly supported by his success at the
gaming tables. The Act of Parliament against gambling
put an end to his chief means of obtaining money. The
Corporation, however, settled a pension of 120 guineas
on him for his services. He was eighty-one years old
at this period, having been born in 1673. His rules for
general behaviour and manners are most amusing, but
are too long to insert.</p>

<p class="greet2">“Since the days that Cupid set Hercules to the
distaff, he has not had a nobler conquest than over
the elevated soul of Mr. Pitt. I congratulate you on
the affinity, and I hope he will be happy: his long
acquaintance with the lady makes the hazard much less
than where people marry without knowing the disposition
of the person they choose. I believe Lady
Hester Grenville is very good-humoured, which is the
principal article in the happiness of the Marriage State.
Beauty soon grows familiar to the lover, wit may be
pernicious, and many brilliant qualities troublesome;
but a companion of gentle disposition softens cares and
lightens sorrows. The sober matches made on reflection,
are often happier than those made by sudden and violent
passion, and I hope this will prove of this kind; and
there is an authority in the character of Mr. Pitt, that
will secure him the deference and obedience of his wife;<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_61">[61]</span>
proud of him abroad, she will be humble to him at home;
and having said so much, I consign them over to Hymen,
who, I hope, will join their hands in the most auspicious
hour. I was prevented writing to you by Sunday’s
post, Dr. Pococke having stayed with us on Saturday
night, and the first Sunday of the month I always go to
Newbury Church;<a id="2_FNanchor_74" href="#2_Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the length of the service made me

<p>“As the Virtues and Graces as well as Cupid and
Hymen will assist at Mr. Pitt’s nuptials, I think he
could not choose a better place for their celebration
than Wickham, their capital seat. I wish them many
happy years together, and God bless them with health
and every good.... I hope while you are at Croydon
the good Archbishop will animate you to defy that foul
fiend my Lord Bolingbroke; I believe I shall take some
of Ward’s sneezing powder to clear my head of the impieties
and impurities of his book. I am not satisfied
with Mr. Warburton’s<a id="2_FNanchor_75" href="#2_Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> answer, the levity shocks me,
the indecency displeases me, the <i>grossièreté</i> disgusts me.
I love to see the doctrine of Christianity defended by
the spirit of Christianity. When absurdity is mix’d
with impiety, it ceases to be a jest. I can laugh at his
Lordship’s cavils at Mr. Locke, his envy to Plato and<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_62">[62]</span>
all the old Philosophers, but I could with great seriousness
apply to him the words of his friend and Poet to the
Dunces—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry-etc">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentqq">“‘’Tis yours a Bacon and a Locke to blame,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The source of Newton’s light or Bacon’s sense.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But I must do his Lordship the justice to say that what
he wants in faith he makes up in confidence, for after
having assured you it is absurd to affirm God is just or
good, he declared he is willing to trust the being whose
attributes he cannot know, to dispose of him in another
world, not at all doubting that the Supreme Being will
be good to him, without goodness, and just to him without
justice! He laughs at the faith of Abraham, and I
should do so too, if Abraham had disputed God’s
veracity, and then trusted to His promises. I never read
such a mass of inconsistencies and contradictions, such
a vain ostentation of learning, and if I durst, I would say
it, all that can show ‘the trifling head, or the corrupted
heart.’ I think I may venture to say trifling, for whatever
does not relate to the argument is so, and to teize
the gentle reader with all the miserable sophisms
that perplex’d the world 2000 years ago, is barbarous.

<p class="from s9">“Croydon, November 18, 1754.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“Your admirable letter found me at the Archiepiscopal
Palace at Croydon, where Mrs. West, Dick
and I had been ever since Wednesday; and it was
lucky that it found me there, as I had by that means an
opportunity of showing the Archbishop, whom you very
properly style good, your most ingenious and judicious
Reflections of Lord Bolingbroke’s pompous Rhetorical
and inconsistent Declamations with which his Grace
(who, by the bye agrees entirely with you in the censure
you there pass’d upon Mr. W(arburton)’s way of answering
him,) was so pleas’d that he desired me to give him
a copy of the whole paragraph, promising that if he
show’d it to anybody he would, however, cautiously
conceal the name of the author. After this I need not
tell you how much we both said in praise of you; I
shall only add that I, this morning, received his commands
to present his respects to you, and to tell you
in his name that if you allow’d yourself the liberty of
saying fine things of him, he would be even with you.
These are his own words, grounded on a piece of
information I had given him of the great honour and
esteem you had for him. We quitted Wickham, as I
told you, on Wednesday last, that we might throw no
obstacle in the way of that amorous impatience which
Mr. Pitt had in all his notes express’d of bringing Lady
Hester to our sweet and hospitable Habitation, as he
call’d it; but to our great surprise, and to the no small
mortification of Mrs. West in particular, who was afraid
that all the good things, with which she had fill’d her
larder, would be spoil’d by their delay—the happy
Bridegroom and his Bride did not arrive till Saturday,
on which morning they were married<a id="2_FNanchor_78" href="#2_Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> by Dr. Ayscough<a id="2_FNanchor_79" href="#2_Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
with the Archbishop’s License. They came down alone,
and have continued alone ever since, and, I imagine, will<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_64">[64]</span>
continue during their stay at Wickham, in that Paradisaical
Solitude, tho’ by the quantity of provisions which
Mr. Campion<a id="2_FNanchor_80" href="#2_Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> brought with him, and more which he has
since sent for from Croydon, we conclude he expected
some visitants from Town, as Lord Temple, etc.,<a id="2_FNanchor_81" href="#2_Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> but
having heard of no such visitants being expected, I
suppose that all this profusion was owing to Mr.
Campion’s solicitude to testify in his own way his
respects to his new Lady, and make his compliments
on this joyous occasion, in the polite, that is, in the
French Phraseology: this is all the intelligence I can
at present give you of this important affair, for we have
had no communication by messages, either to or from
Mr. Pitt, whom we were unwilling to disturb, or
interrupt the free course of those pleasures, which for a
time at least, possess the whole mind, and are most
relished when most private; for this reason I cannot
yet acquaint you when we shall leave Wickham, but
I believe it will be about the middle of this week,
and I suppose we shall not be able to go to Chelsea
before the latter end of the next, or the beginning of the
week after, and by that time I am still in hopes you will
come to Hill Street, and by giving me the pleasure of
seeing you there in good health, compleat the happy
change which you observe is already begun in the once
gloomy month of November. I do often, my dear
Cousin, look back with pleasure and thankfulness on
many incidents of my past Life, and compare them with
my present situation, so much changed for the better
in a thousand instances, such as Health, fortune and
Friendship, among which there is none that has given
me more happiness than yours, and which therefore I
hope will continue, till it is lost where only it can be
lost, in the brighter and warmer radiance of an unchangeable
and everlasting Society, where I hope to
have it continued to me through all eternity. I am
going to take the air with the good and amiable Archbishop,
and therefore must conclude.</p>

<p>“I imagine that you will be glad to hear the history

nor is it the least that the most profound arithmetician

‘<cite lang="fr">Probabilités de la Vie Humaine</cite>’ in his pocket, never
foresaw that spending ten times his income would ruin
his fortune, and that he found no way to make the book
of debtor and creditor even, but paying that debt which
dissolves all other obligations. You will guess I mean
Lord Montfort and his pistol. He had not discovered
any marks of insanity, on the contrary, all was deliberate,
calm and cool; having said so much of his indiscretion,
I think, with the rest of the world, I may acquit him of
the imputation of cunning and sharping, but what can
one say in defence of a conduct that had all the appearance
of deep knavery and the consequences of inconsiderate
rashness and folly.... Many reasons have<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_68">[68]</span>
been given for his Lordship’s violent act, but by what I
learn from those best acquainted with his person and
fortune, he was not under the pressure of any very
heavy debt, but had a true Epicurean character, loved a
degree of voluptuousness that his fortune could not
afford, and a splendour of life it could not supply,
much of his relish for the world was lost, and like
one that has no appetite to ordinary fare, chose to
rise from table unless fortune would make him a feast....
When Lord Montfort’s children were paid their
demands on his estate, I hear he had only £1200 a year
clear, and in table, equipage and retinue he equalled,
and in the first article perhaps excell’d, the largest fortunes.
To retrench or die was the question, he reasoned
like Hamlet, but left out the great argument of a future
state.”</p>

french mottoes to explain those tender glances. We

<p>“Mr. Montagu has been studiously disposed ever
since we came to Sandleford, so that I pass seven or

<div class="sidenote">MR. TORRIANO’S MARRIAGE</div>

<p>Mention is also made of Sam Torriano’s engagement
to Miss Scudamore, “who is said to have been handsome,
and it was on both sides a marriage of inclination.
He has delicacy enough to make him very happy or
very miserable, and restlessness enough to be very
uneasy in a state too insipid to allow of neither.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu might well make this remark on
Torriano’s marriage, as her friend Sir George Lyttelton’s<a id="2_FNanchor_86" href="#2_Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
second matrimonial contract had by mutual consent
ended in a separation. In a former letter it will
be remembered that the haughty tone and unpleasant
manners of the lady were commented on. It was a case
of incompatibility of temper and thought, and a constant
imagination of bad health on her part. Lady Lyttelton
was a great friend of the Wests, and from a letter of
Lyttelton’s to West of this year it is evident that a little
coldness, which did not endure long, had sprung up
between West and his friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. WEST ILL</div>

<p>On July 8 and July 14 Sir George Lyttelton writes to
Archibald Bower a complete diary of his tour in North
Wales, accompanied by “Parson Durant and Mr. Payne.”
These letters Bower gave to Mrs. Montagu. They contain
many messages to the “Madonna,” but are, though
interesting, too long to insert here. At this period West
was at Tunbridge Wells, seeking health, but depressed
at the absence of Pitt, Lyttelton, Torriano, and, above
all, Mrs. Montagu; and from this letter it appears that
1750 was the year in which they first made friends at
Tunbridge. “Where are the happy seasons of 1750,
1751, 1752, and 1753?” he cries. “In the ‘Stone House’
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_73">[73]</span>are Mr. Walpole and Lady Rachel, persons with whom
I have no concern.” The only people he now consorts
with are Mrs. Vesey, to whom he talks of Mrs. Montagu,
“we both love and honour you;” and Bishop
Gilbert and his daughter.<a id="2_FNanchor_87" href="#2_Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The Bishop of London
was expected. West laments “a difficulty of breathing,
accompanied with wheezing,” he thought asthma. “The
Doctors said Hysterical as only fit for <i>petticoats</i>!”
They prescribed assafœtida, valerian, and gum ammoniac.
He laments that Torriano “has done the irrevocable
deed, and is married on £500 per annum.”</p>

Three doctors had treated her, and now Dr.

<p>“A Captain Cunningham past through Guildford last

Scotia with advice that Col. Warburton of the land
forces had taken a fort at the back of Louisbourg called
Bouche, (by the bye the most material Fort belonging to
the French settlements), 500 men and 20 cannon; that
the Colonel had blocked up Louisbourg by land, and
Admiral Boscawen had done the same by sea; that the
town was very bare of provisions and must soon surrender,
and the sooner as the Colonel has turned in the
500 brethren to help to consume the faster; so that there
is great reason to suppose we shall soon be masters of
Louisbourg, and the Admiral of the 4 French men of war
blocked in the Harbour. We have taken papers of the
utmost consequence, which let us into the secret
schemes of the French, which were nothing less than a

<p>West, writing on August 22 from Tunbridge Wells,
mentions that Lady Cobham and Harriet had left them
for Stoke, Mrs. Vesey was returning to Ireland, and the
Bishop of London had just left, “but while he was here
put into my hands some sheets of a third Volume of
Discourses now printing, which, as I had the chief hand

South Carolina. This was William Henry, brother of

<p>Travile becoming slightly better, Mrs. Montagu went
to Bath Easton to visit Mrs. Scott and Lady Bab Montagu.
In a letter to Dr. Gilbert West, October 16, after
her return to Sandleford, the following account is given
of the life led by the two lady friends:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My sister rises early, and as soon as she has read
prayers to their small family, she sits down to cut out
and prepare work for 12 poor girls, whose schooling
they pay for; to those whom she finds more than
ordinarily capable, she teaches writing and arithmetic
herself. The work these children are usually employed
in is making child-bed linen and clothes for poor people
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_79">[79]</span>in the neighbourhood, which Lady Bab Montagu and she,
bestow as they see occasion. Very early on Sunday
morning these girls, with 12 little boys whom they also
send to school, come to my sister and repeat their
catechism, read some chapters, have the principal
articles of their religion explained to them, and then are
sent to the parish church. These good works are often
performed by the Methodist ladies in the heat of enthusiasm,
but thank God, my sister’s is a calm and
rational piety. Her conversation is lively and easy, and
she enters into all the reasonable pleasures of Society;
goes frequently to the plays, and sometimes to balls,
etc. They have a very pretty house at Bath for the
winter, and one at Bath Easton for the summer; their
houses are adorned by the ingenuity of the owners, but
as their income is small, they deny themselves unnecessary
expenses. My sister<a id="2_FNanchor_99" href="#2_Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> seems very happy; it has
pleased God to lead her to truth, by the road of affliction;
but what draws the sting of death and triumphs
over the grave, cannot fail to heal the wounds of disappointment.
Lady Bab Montagu concurs with her in
all these things, and their convent, for by its regularity
it resembles one, is really a cheerful place.”</p>

governess, would keep a journal of all the instructions
the young lady has, and all her employments, and the
world might get a better treatise of education than any
yet extant. Mr. Pope says of Voiture ‘that trifles themselves
were elegant in him,’ a moderate praise to a man
who dealt only in trifles, but Mr. Pitt mixes the elegant
with the sublime.”</p>

be gathering laurels, but as they are a deadly plant, I
could wish he was at his inglorious fireside. I am very
uneasy for the poor woman (Mrs. Boscawen) who is
still at Portsmouth, if any accident should happen to

<p>“I imagine my dear sister would see a paragraph in
the newspaper that would excuse my not having written
to her a farther account of my poor friend, Mr. West.
On the melancholy event I brought his sister to Hill
Street, where she is to stay a few days to recover in
some measure the consequences of her fatigue and the
shock her spirits have received. Mrs. West is with
Lady Cobham. She is sensible of her great loss, but
says she will behave under her affliction worthy the<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_87">[87]</span>
example of her excellent and worthy husband, and his
sentiments of resignation to the will of God, this resolution
join’d to natural good spirits and vivacity of mind,
supports her in a surprizing manner. I wish the good
man could have known she would have endured her
misfortune so well, apprehensions for her were all that
disturbed the peace, I might almost say the joy of his
deathbed. Miss West went thro’ the sad duties of
nursing with great fortitude, but, she is much affected
by her loss; the Admiral<a id="2_FNanchor_116" href="#2_Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> his brother is in deep affliction,
Lady Langham<a id="2_FNanchor_117" href="#2_Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> finds great resources in a very

<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_88">[88]</span>at Kensington. William seems to have been rather a
<i>souffre douleur</i> all his life, which annoyed his sister perpetually:
his harping on small worries and domestic
trifles is constantly alluded to. Mr. Botham bids him
“fight a good fight, and by diligence and spirit in his

probably from being nearest in age to her.</p>

<p>On June 24, in a letter to Mrs. Boscawen, this sad
subject is touched on—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know not how to reconcile myself to the loss of
one of the companions of my youth, the recollections of
one’s earliest season, the spring of life is usually pleasant
and gay, but whenever it offers itself to my mind, I cannot
help asking where are those who were my playfellows?
Faith should answer, with their Maker, reason, patience,
resignation, should take place, but there is a weakness
and stubbornness too in the human habit.... My poor
sister bears her loss patiently, but it touches her heart
very sorely.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Montagu had just come in from the coffee-house.
Mr. Byng’s<a id="2_FNanchor_122" href="#2_Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> expedition is unfortunate, not to say disgraceful,

was agreed in the Council of War that as there were
18,000 Frenchmen there, it would be these men; then
it was agitated whether they should engage with the
French, that was also carried in the negative; the third
question was whether they should go to take care of
Gibraltar, which was agreed on. Alas! Alas! the report
to-day is that Admiral West’s son is dead: one should
lament this if we had not greater reason to lament that

wild and dissolute life. She continues—</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. MORRIS ROBINSON’S MARRIAGE</div>

<p>During this summer Morris Robinson, Mrs. Montagu’s
third brother, married Miss Jane Greenland, daughter of
John Greenland, of Lovelace, Co. Kent, who was the
eldest son of Augustine Greenland, of Belle Vue, Kent.
Her mother was Jane Weller, of Kingsgate House,
Rolveden, Kent, of a good family. Mrs. Montagu did
not like the marriage, though she finally adopted their
second son, her nephew,<a id="2_FNanchor_130" href="#2_Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Matthew Robinson, and made
him take the name of Montagu. There never was any
cordiality between the sisters-in-law. Mrs. Morris
Robinson was a violent-tempered woman, and, despite
her good birth, very illiterate, which, to a person like
her sister-in-law, was extremely annoying, the more so
as Morris was one of her favourite brothers, and
extremely clever. As mentioned before, he belonged
to the Six Clerks’ office, and managed both the legal
affairs of the Duke of Montagu and Mr. Montagu.</p>

<p>Writing from Hagley<a id="2_FNanchor_131" href="#2_Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> on August 11, Miss West
gives an account of her brave young nephew, who had
been wounded, not killed, as at first reported—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My nephew<a id="2_FNanchor_132" href="#2_Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> is at Portsmouth, not being able to
bear travelling. He has been in danger from his wound,
it beginning to mortify, but he is now in a fair way of
recovery. He has shown a spirit suited to his profession,
and to the grandson of Admiral John Balchen,<a id="2_FNanchor_133" href="#2_Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> for when
his Father proposed to send him on board a frigate, with
Byng’s nephew, who was ordered to leave my brother’s
ship by his uncle, Admiral Byng, before the engagement
began, being, like my nephew, too young to be of use.
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_93">[93]</span>My nephew remonstrated very strongly, ‘that Mr. Byng
was only a passenger, but he belonged to the ship he
was in, and therefore it would be such a disgrace that
he could never show his head again, should he quit it at
such a juncture:’ this joined to lamentation and importunity
prevailed; when he received his wound his Father
ran to pick him up and said, ‘I hope you are not much
hurt?’ ‘I believe I am killed, but pray don’t mind me,
Papa,’ answered the poor fellow.... Hagley is now
blessed with its master, who came on Monday last with
good health, looks and spirits. I was glad to see him
accompanied by Stillingfleet, so worthy a man deserves
such a countenance, and he is so unexceptionable that
no censure can arise from any favours confer’d on him.”</p>

<p>Sarah Scott at this time had a dangerous fever at
Clifton, where she and Lady Bab had gone to drink the
waters. Writing to her, Mrs. Montagu remarks upon the
growing eccentricities of their brother Matthew,<a id="2_FNanchor_134" href="#2_Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> who
lived upon almost raw meat, and never touched bread at
all, considering corn as exotic, and therefore diminishing
British trade, at the same time avoiding sugar for the
same reason, substituting honey for it.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</div>

<p>He lived in the plainest, simplest manner himself, but
was mighty hospitable to all who came to Horton. He
gradually pulled down the many walled gardens round
the house, as well as hedges, and threw the whole of
his grounds into one large park, where his cattle roamed
at will. He dressed plainly, and allowed his beard (then
an unusual hirsute ornament) to grow; but as Sir
Egerton Brydges,<a id="2_FNanchor_135" href="#2_Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> who eventually became his nephew
by marriage, remarks, “he carried his hatred of artificialities
through everything.... He was the reverse of
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_94">[94]</span>his Father, who was never happy out of the high and
polished society and clubs of London, and thought a
country life a perfect misery.” Matthew was, however,
greatly esteemed by his neighbours and constituents,
was a great reader, and wrote some clever political
pamphlets.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt had taken such a fancy to Hayes since Mrs.
Montagu had lent him her house there, that he bought
it soon after her tenancy expired, as will be seen by
this passage in a letter of Bower’s to Mrs. Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Pitt is doing great things at Hayes, he has
bought the house, and the house hard by, and some
fields. He has built a wall towards the public road 13
feet high. He intends to pull down the old house, and
build another in the middle of the garden. His neighbour
Elly asks an exorbitant price for his house, £500.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mary Pitt, writing from Hayes on September 16,
mentions she is leaving to go to Howberry to the
Nedhams,<a id="2_FNanchor_136" href="#2_Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> in order to make room for Lady Hester’s
extra attendants, as Lady Hester was expecting her
confinement. Mrs. Montagu went for ten days to Bath
Easton to see Mrs. Scott. Lord Lyttelton, writing to
Mrs. Montagu on October 23, to enquire as to her health
and Mrs. Scott’s, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Fox<a id="2_FNanchor_137" href="#2_Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> has determined to lay down the seals,
because he says he has not support or credit sufficient
to carry on the King’s business in the House of Commons,
and Mr. Pitt will not take them under the Duke of Newcastle.
What will be the consequence of all this I can’t
tell, my fears are great for the publick, for myself I have
none in any event: the worst that can happen to me is
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_95">[95]</span>to remain in the office I am in under the Duke of Newcastle,

to enjoy the Madonna’s conversation, instead of
hearing the nonsensical speculations of the town....
Little Tom is quite well and desires his best compliments.

<div class="sidenote">DR. MESSENGER MONSEY</div>

<p>Further he alludes to Pitt being laid up with gout at
Hayes, “a legacy you left him,” alluding to her formerly
owning Pitt’s residence at that place. Then he mentions
Stillingfleet having been staying at Sandleford, and says,
“Monsey swears he will make out some story of you
and him before you are much older; you shall not keep
blew stockings at Sandleford for nothing.” This is the
first allusion to blue stockings, but that Stillingfleet’s
wearing blue stockings gave the name to the coterie
entirely, must be false. He was, however, a very learned
man, especially upon botany. In later letters allusion
is made to his having left off wearing blue stockings!
The coterie of friends probably was named thus after
the famous <i lang="fr">bas bleu</i> assemblies of Paris, held in the
<i lang="fr">salons</i> of Madame de Polignac in the Rue St. Honoré,
where the wearing of blue stockings was the rage: but
Dr. Monsey is mentioned for the first time here. Dr.
Messenger Monsey was the son of a clergyman; he
was born in 1698, so was fifty-eight years old at this
date. He was a doctor and surgeon, and became private
physician to the Earl of Godolphin, and afterwards
physician to Chelsea Hospital. He was most eccentric,
and, if his portrait at the Soane Museum was like
him, hideous in appearance; but he had a coarse rough-and-tumble
wit, and evidently was so droll in manner,
that he became a sort of pet buffoon of the Montagu
and Lyttelton circle. His letters are interminably long;
written in such small though neat writing, a magnifying
glass is required for careful perusal. He was at this
time a widower, with one married daughter, Charlotte,
whose husband, William Alexander, was elder brother
to the 1st Earl of Caledon. Mrs. Alexander had one
child, a daughter, Jemima, who married the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Edmund Rolfe, and was mother eventually of the 1st
Baron Cranworth. Monsey’s letters are so coarse one<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_99">[99]</span>
can hardly imagine the <i lang="fr">bas bleus</i> putting up with them.
Dr. Monsey begged Dr. Cruickshank, in case of his
dying away from his own doctor (Dr. Forster), to dissect
his body before the students, set up his skeleton for
instruction, and put his flesh in a box and throw it into
the Thames. He must either have been very swarthy,
or disliked soap and water, as Torriano, in allusion to
Monsey’s threat of inventing a story about Stillingfleet
and Mrs. Montagu, says, “Your fame, which was as fair
as Dian’s visage, will be soon black and begrim’d like
the Doctor’s own face!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMIN</div>

<p>During this year Mrs. Montagu had also formed an
acquaintance with an Armenian named Joseph Ameen,
or Emin. He was the son of a merchant, and born at
Hamadan, whither his father had been carried captive
by the Persians. His father at last escaped to Calcutta,
after being slave to Kouli Khan for many years. The
Persians, ever since 1604, under Shah Abbas, had
frequently made inroads into Armenia, captured the
majority of the inhabitants, and carried them away as
slaves into Persia. Emin grew up with a passionate
desire to free his country from oppression and the
yoke of unbelievers, for the Armenians were then, as
now, Christians. Emin says of his father in a letter to
his patron, the Earl of Northumberland<a id="2_FNanchor_145" href="#2_Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My Father taught me like other Armenians only to
write and read in our own language, and to get Psalms
by heart to sing in Church, but he did not show me how
to handle arms to fight for that Church, as my Uncle did
who was killed at his Church door, nor anything to
kindle up my heart to understand great affairs.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMIN’S TROUBLES — EMIN’S FORTUNES</div>

<p>Burning to learn “the art of war” as practised by
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_100">[100]</span>the British soldiers in India, and his father opposing
him, Emin determined on flight to England, and,
taking what money he possessed, he “kissed the feet
of Capt. Fox of the ship <i>Walpole</i> a hundred times to
let me work<a id="2_FNanchor_146" href="#2_Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> my passage to Europe before he would
heed to me, but he did at last admit me, and I came to
England with much labour.” Arrived in England, he
entered Mr. Middleton’s Academy, and was first a scholar,
and then, when his money was exhausted, worked there
as a servant for his learning. His master becoming
bankrupt, Emin lost his all, and was reduced to the
streets. At last he obtained service with a Mr. Rogers,
a grocer, as porter. “In this time I carried burthens of
near 200 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> upon my back, and paid out of my wages
to learn geometry, complete my writing, and learn a
little French.” Overstraining himself, he could no longer
carry such heavy burthens, and was reduced to living
on 1½<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> a day, but a friend recommended him to a Mr.
Webster, an attorney in Cheapside, with whom he got
work for a time. His uncle sent £60 to Governor Davis
to take Emin home to India, but after a while, meeting
“by chance some gentlemen<a id="2_FNanchor_147" href="#2_Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> who encouraged me and
lent me books, and advised me to kiss Colonel Dingley’s
hands and show him my business, he was a brave
soldier, took me by the hand, spoke to his own Sergeant,
an honest man, to teach me Manuel Exercise, and gave
me ‘Bland’s Military Discipline’ and promised to help
me learn gunnery and fortification.” Unfortunately
Colonel Dingley died, and Emin, in despair, and by the
advice of the gentlemen mentioned before, who appear
from the letters to have been a Calcutta lawyer and<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_101">[101]</span>
Edmund Burke, applied to the Earl of Northumberland
in a long letter, passages of which I have quoted. Emin
proposes that his lordship should apply to Governor
Davis for some of the money his uncle had sent to pay
for his passage back to India to enable him (Emin) to
join the “black Armenians in the mountains, as I heard
they had never been conquered,” to teach him the art of
war. The Earl of Northumberland at last—after Emin
waiting at his house often from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.!—took
notice of him, and sent his servant to fetch him to see
him, and on hearing his story, said, “Ameen, it is very
hard to live in this country without friends and without
money, almost four years, therefore the Lord is with
you, be contented, I will from this time provide and
furnish you with all necessaries,” and, said he, “I will
mediate to the son of our King, and after you have
learned the art of war, I will send you to your Father
and your Uncles: the noble lady<a id="2_FNanchor_148" href="#2_Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> comforted me also
likewise.” Lord Northumberland introduced Emin to
Sir Charles Stanhope,<a id="2_FNanchor_149" href="#2_Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and he in turn to Lord Cathcart,<a id="2_FNanchor_150" href="#2_Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
who gave him great encouragement. Lord Northumberland
now introduced him to the Duke of Cumberland,
who henceforth took an interest in him. Emin applied
for military service in a long letter to Heraclius <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>,
King of Georgia and Armenia, who was anxious to
shake off the yoke of the Persians, but evidently the
reply was delayed, and the next we hear of him is that
he had been sent to Woolwich Academy, “to Mr.
Heaton’s on Church Hill,” to learn the “art of war.”
Having effected a reconciliation with his father, it is<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_102">[102]</span>

this noble patron, the Earl of Northumberland—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="sidenote">“MY QUEEN OF SHEBA”</div>

<p>On May 10, 1757, Emin writes from Woolwich to
implore Mrs. Montagu to use her influence with her
brother-in-law, Mr. Medows, who was intimate with the
Duke of Marlborough, to get him a commission in the
Royal Artillery, in order to enable him to join the British
army then fighting to defend Hanover, and assist the
King of Prussia against the inroads of the French.</p>

<p>This letter, speaking of Mrs. Montagu, addresses her
as “My Queen of Sheba,” and alludes to all “the noble
ladies of her circle,” and Dr. Monsey as “my honest,
dear Dr. Monsey.”</p>

<p>From a letter printed in my grandfather’s collection
of his aunt’s letters, dated March 8, 1757, but which I do
not possess, Mrs. Montagu writes to Dr. Monsey, then
at Gog Magog, Lord Godolphin’s Cambridgeshire seat—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“That is because you have made me well!
Dear Sir, because you make me laugh!”</p>
</div>

<p>In this letter, too long to insert here, she says “there
have been great efforts to save Mr. Byng.” She says
Stillingfleet had left off his blue stockings, and was at
gay operas and assemblies each night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WINDSOR ELECTION</div>

<p>From Windsor Castle, where Lady Sandwich had<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_103">[103]</span>

Bowles’ friend, owns he had a legal majority of nine.
The boxers and the bruisers Mr. Fox had on his side
beat the Windsor mob out of the Field, but they had
once the courage to attack Mr. Fox’s person, and pulled
off his wig, and threw it in his face. In short the affair
has been very tumultuous. The town is quiet, none are
actually dead, but four or five are dangerously ill, and
the Doctors and Apothecarys had a great harvest of
bruises and fractures.... The ladies wore party gowns,
Fox’s is partly yellow and green, and the others blue;

<p>“I have been at Malvern about twelve days, where
with difficulty i have got a lodging, the place is so very
full, nor do i wonder at it, there being some instances of
very extraordinary cures in cases looked on as desperate,
even by Dr. Wall,<a id="2_FNanchor_155" href="#2_Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> the Physician, who first brought
the waters into vogue. I do not doubt but that the air
and exercise, which at present is absolutely necessary
here, the Well being at over two miles<a id="2_FNanchor_156" href="#2_Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> from the town,
contribute very much towards restoring the health of
the patients. The road is very fine, and made on purpose
for the drinkers. It is on the side of a hill, which
i am told is found by exact mensuration in some part to
be half a mile perpendicularly high, above a wide plain
that lies at the bottom. Towards the well the road
ascends considerably, so that i imagine the end of it is
not much less than halfway up to the top. A gentleman
in the neighbourhood has, at his own expense, made a
walk a little above the well; this walk runs on a level
for about 600 yards, winding with the breaks of the hill,
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_105">[105]</span>and makes the noblest terrace i ever saw, the plain over
which you look being bounded by some fine hills, and
on it, lying on one side, Worcester, on the other Gloucester.
The hill is fed with sheep, here and there some
cattle graze, overhead I see my favourite bird, the Kite,
sailing, and all the while i tread on porphyry, the consciousness
of which, you may guess, adds not a little to
my satisfaction, when i consider that Princes are proud
to have a few pillars of this material.... The town lies
high on the side of the hill, and still on Porphyry. The
church, which stands a little lower, was a Priory....
Not far below the Church is a spring of the same nature
with that of Tunbridge.... I wish this place was
nearer to London, for it seems exactly adapted to do
you good.... There is a subscription going forward
for building a large lodging-house near the Well. At
present there is only one old house in the town, turned
entirely to that purpose, which contains about fifteen
persons, and one large room in it, where once a week
there is a sort of public breakfast and dinner. We have
had one public tea-drinking and card-playing in the
afternoon, by particular invitation; to-day it will begin
on another footing, and is to be weekly.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">TO “KILLUM.” — “KILLUM.”</div>

<p>Soon after the receipt of this letter, Mrs. Montagu
set out on a visit to Lady Bab Montagu and Mrs. Scott
at Bath Easton, and Mr. Montagu, on July 28, writes
to say he purposes driving to “Killum”<a id="2_FNanchor_157" href="#2_Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> to see his
friend Mr. Stevens.<a id="2_FNanchor_158" href="#2_Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> “Killum” was Culham Court,
Berks. George Stevens, a very eccentric character,
afterwards, in 1766, published an edition of Shakespeare,
and three years later some notes were incorporated in it
of Dr. Johnson’s. Mr. Montagu writes this description
of “Killum”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_106">[106]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His house is a very good one, built about fifty
years ago, the rooms large and wainscoated with oak,
and three very good bedchambers with beds that at
some time cost a good deal of money, but are the worse
for time. He has been pulling down walls, and everything
lyes rough and without order or neatness, and to
finish the account of it, very much resembled its owner.
Its situation is what I think fine and much pleases me,
it is in a Valley which begins at the foot of that hill
which we see on Maidenhead Thickett, and goes as far
as Henley and further. The Thames runs quite through
it, is of good breadth, and with a great number of little
islands scatter’d here and there makes a most beautyfull
appearance. On the bank of this river, on a terrass the
house is built, it is of considerable extent, and if adorn’d
with plantations and buildings would be very pretty
and pleasant, but to do this may require a greater
expense than may be convenient, so that all he at present
thinks of doing is the improving the lawn....
You might blame me if I omitted giving you some
account of one of a kind very uncommon. I mean Mr.
Hart’s<a id="2_FNanchor_159" href="#2_Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Chinese house. This stands in a beech wood
of Mr. Stevens about half a mile from him. Consists
of a suite of rooms pav’d with pantyles and hung with
paper, and on the outside is embellish’d with very costly
decoration of the Chinese manner. Mr. Stevens says
the cost has been about two thousand pounds, but I
don’t believe three would pay for it. It seems to me
no more than a whim, and so much money flung away.
It stands very high, and has a more extensive view than
Mr. Stevens’. It might be agreeable to entertain a
company there in the finest and warmest weather, but
one cannot think of it as an habitation without shuddering.
At present no use is made of it; three servants
are kept there who have no other business than to look
after the house, keep the wood walks in order, and
breed pheasants; in about 15 years the lease expires,
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_107">[107]</span>and then it comes to Mr. Stevens.” Mr. Montagu says,
“I have some other thoughts of taking another ramble
about the middle of the week to Winchester, and
perhaps Southampton.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu had written to ask for a pair of horses

horse at 6<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> a day!” Mr. Montagu sends them, but says,

<p>“I look upon Mr. Stevens as a man who has disfranchised
himself from all slavery to custom and fashion,
and who as seldom brushes up or new trims his modes
of living as his coat, but wears both as long as they fit
him, in spite of what fops and taylors may say. I hope
he will come to Sandleford, for he has parts enough to
make his singularities amusing. I dare say he was very
happy in the visit you made him, both for the pleasure
of your conversation and from a little vanity, for tho’
the modes of singularity may give a man an air of designing
to live alone and of contemplation, in the world,
I believe one may venture to say, none are more desirous
of regard and notice than those who affect to retire and
be singular; they rather design their peculiarities for a
badge of distinction than a line of separation between
them and Society; and a man in low life may go ungarter’d
or cross-garter’d, who in another station would
have been ambitious of a blue garter, and their installment
into a particular character is a matter of great wit....
We had a report that the Duke had killed 3000

I had a letter from Mr. Emin that the Duke of Cumberland

<p class="greet2">“I believe your ladyships have been in a long
expectation to hear from this part of the world, more
especially of the battle which began on the 23rd of
July. In the morning we were ordered out with 25
horses and 200 foot irregulars to secure a post, where
we found 300 husars and 700 foot soldiers, upon which
we began immediately to fire, and they retreated very
soon; and in the afternoon his highness, hearing that
the French were advancing with their whole army,
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_109">[109]</span>ordered that the part of his army were to advance
also, but it was very unlucky for us that our infantry
was too late; and before they could come up, the enemy
begun from some distance to fire upon us with their
cannon, with no manner of execution. His Royal Highness
thought proper to return to his camp in Aferden.
The next day, the enemy, still advancing from their camp
at Halla all along the river Vizer,<a id="2_FNanchor_161" href="#2_Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and were retreating
untill we halted upon a high hill with full of trees, and
they on another; were the firing of cannon began again
on both sides, and lasted till evening. Our situation not
being so well as we could wish, we still retreated till we
come to Hamelin,<a id="2_FNanchor_162" href="#2_Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> there we posted the right of our army,
and our left at Onsburg, and unfortunate Hastenbek<a id="2_FNanchor_163" href="#2_Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
between us and the enemy, which was soon burnt down.
The 25th, about four in the morning, the enemy began
to advance with their musicks and drums, making a very
great noise, more like Indians than Europeans, and was
soon silenced; as a few of our balls, and cannonading
begun of both sides briskly. At that time your slave
was upon a hill with no more than 200 irregulars, commanded
by my friend, Major Freydag, a man of good
conduct and judgment, where we could see the two
armies very plain. It was a place had it not been so
dangerous as the cannon balls were flying like so many
flies over our heads, I would wish my noble friend ladies
who are my patronesses and who are so fond of Heros
and hearing of battles, to have seen it, which would
really have been worth their while; then I would have
wished again that the heavenly chariots where descended
from the gods above, to have transported them to their
native and blessed Island, peradventure they should have
been in the greatest of dangers, for wee saw about eleven
of the clock the enemy with no less than six thousand of
Horses and Foot comming up to us of all sides with a
great fury, except a little grass that led us down to our
army, but this bravery of theirs was greatly owing to an
information which they had of us a day before. Knowing<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_110">[110]</span>
that we were no more than two hundred men, or else
they woud not be so furious in their attack, for they are
vastly like the black Indians, fire at a great distance and
run away. However, we stood almost half an hour, our
men ralyed three times and killed no less than 300 of
them; for our men are brought up from their infantry
(<i>sic!</i>) as huntsmen, they never miss their mark. I have
seen them shoot at 300 yards’ distance; they are like the
mountiniers of Armenia and Dagastun, the French husars
run away as soon as they see us. You see, my noble
ladies, what great advantage it is to a Nation who has
the liberty not only to kill the partridges but to kill as
many deers and other animals as they please. The loss
of ours was but 20 and 6 wounded, we could not support
any longer and where obliged to retreat, and join the
army, and about 2 a-clock in the afternoon, the enemy
retreated with the loss of eleven cannon, and had taken
some of ours, but we retaken them again, but the battle
continued still and lasted from 4 in the morning to 6 in
the afternoon, the loss of their side was about 3000 and
about 1200 of ours, we don’t look upon this as a battle
in Persia, but as a scarmish (<i>sic!</i>). The inventor of gunpowder
tho’ he is cursed by many ignorant people but
his invention has been a very great service towards
preservation of Mankind, gunpowder is a thing which
makes a great noise like lightning and thunder keep
mankind distant with an awe. ‘The thought of gunpowder,’
says the great Marshal de Saxe, ‘is more than
the danger itself.’ I woud wish to have no more than
1500 Persian Horse if it is not too bold and your humble
servant the teacher of them, we could soon show the
French that the effect of symiters (<i>sic</i>) would be greater
than that of gunpowder tho’ their number of what we
hear is one hundred fifty thousand men and ours are
you very well know. At present we are upon marches
and countermarches.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Talbot,<a id="2_FNanchor_166" href="#2_Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> writing from Barrington,<a id="2_FNanchor_167" href="#2_Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> bids Mrs.
Montagu to come and stay with her. The letter is not a
remarkable one, but it says, “Have you heard lately
from Lady Sandwich? I find the old Countess<a id="2_FNanchor_168" href="#2_Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> is dead
at last at Paris.” This was the eccentric Elizabeth Wilmot,
sister of <i>the</i> Earl of Rochester, and grandmother of
John, Lord Sandwich, widow of the 3rd Earl. It is said
she governed her husband to such a degree that he was
almost a cypher and a prisoner in his own house, she
being, though an indifferent wife, a most brilliant spirited
woman. After her lord’s death in 1729, she lived in
Paris, where she was the friend of Ninon de l’Enclos
and St. Evremont. Both Pope and Lord Chesterfield
have mentioned her as extremely spirited and having
great intellectual ability.</p>

<p>Her daughter-in-law, Lady Hinchinbroke, <i>née</i> Elizabeth
Popham, lost her husband, Lord Hinchinbroke, in
1722, and I have several curious letters written by her to
Mrs. Montagu in 1739, respecting her son John, 4th Earl
of Sandwich (“Jemmy Twitcher”). He was then eleven
years old, and his mother sent him to sea. Probably he
was even then very unruly, but he could not bear the
sea, and through Mr. Montagu she applied to their
common connection, John, Duke of Montagu, to get
him a commission in the Army, buying it “as an
ensign in a marching regiment.” The duke’s reply to
this is singularly indifferent in expression, and his
spelling terrible.</p>

<p>On August 6, writing from Bath Easton to her

Bevern, it had not happen’d; there is something more
great perhaps in a Monarch owning his error than in
gaining a victory, but it will not have the same effect in
establishing his affairs in Germany, so that in his situation
the least advantage over the Empress Queen<a id="2_FNanchor_169" href="#2_Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>

<p>Writing to Dr. Stillingfleet on August 7, in return for

description of Emin—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Emin was most graciously received by the
Duke, had offers of money and all marks of regard from
his Royal Highness, so that his letters express the
highest satisfaction ... there must be a nobler seat
than the Persian throne reserved for that fine spirit
which, born in slavery and nurtured in ignorance, aspired
to give liberty, knowledge, and civil arts to his country.
To compass this he risqued his life, and endured the
greatest hardships, and ventured all dangers and uncertainties
in a country whose very language he was a
stranger to; how different from so many of our countrymen,
who for little additions of power and greater gratifications
of luxury, in spite of their pride of birth and<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_115">[115]</span>

<div class="sidenote">LADY LYTTELTON’S TEMPER</div>

<p>In a letter from <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Lyttelton from Hagley

Lyttelton’s temper. He says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My brother Lord Lyttelton returned from his
Welsh expedition the same day I came home, and you
will easily believe how welcome he was to Miss West
and me, as we had nobody to converse with or rather to
eat with, but ye amiable Lady of ye house, for she does
not deign to converse or hardly say a single word to
either of us. On Saturday, Hester<a id="2_FNanchor_171" href="#2_Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> arrived, so we are

<p>On September 15 Mrs. Montagu wrote a long letter
to Dr. Stillingfleet from Sandleford. In this she alludes
to the humorous affection for her which Dr. Monsey
had developed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You must know Sir, Dr. Monsey is fallen desperately
in love with me, and I am most passionately in
love with him, the darts on both sides have not been the
porcupine’s, but the grey goose quill. We have said so
many tender things to each other by the post, that at last
we thought it would be better to sigh in soft dialogue
than by letter. We agreed to meet, and the rather, as
all the lovers we had read of (and being in love with
each other only <i lang="fr">du coté de l’esprit</i>, you may suppose
we woo by book) had always complained of absence as
the most dreadful thing imaginable. He said, nay he
swore, he would come to Sandleford, and twice had
named the day, but each time his grand-daughter fell
sick, and I know not whether he will keep the third
appointment, which is for next Monday. These disappointments
have made me resolve, and I really believe
it will not be difficult to keep the resolution, never again
to fall in love with a man who is a grandfather. In all
other respects the Doctor is a perfect Pastor Fido, and I
believe when we get to Elysium, all the lovers who
wander in the Myrtle Groves there will throw their
garlands at our feet.”</p>

<p>Further on she alludes to Emin, who was at Stadt,
and had written her a most devoted letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

the failure of the Hawke and Mordaunt expedition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am a little uneasy lest the surprize should have

which I hope his country will reap from his arms, but
think me not ignoble if I own, glory is but a bright
moonshine when compared to your welfare, and think
me not below the standard of true patriotism, if I confess,
it is for the sake of such as you, my country is a
name so dear. I know you are too reasonable to wish
Mr. Boscawen might avoid the hazards of his profession.

of war. Be not afraid, but commit it all to the great
and wise Disposer of all events; a firm hope and cheerful
reliance on Providence I do believe to be the best
means to bring about what we wish, and that such confidence
does it far better than all our anxious foresight,
our provident schemes and measuring of security. I
remember with sorrow and shame, I trusted much to a
continual watching of my son,<a id="2_FNanchor_177" href="#2_Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> I would not have committed
him to a sea voyage, or for the world in a town
besieged, I forgot at Whose will the waves are still, and
Who breaketh the bow and knappeth the spear asunder.
What was the reward of this confidence of my own care
and diffidence of His who only could protect him?
Why, such as it deserved, I lost my beloved object, and
with him my hopes, my joys, and my health, and I lost
him too, not by those things I had feared for him, but by
the pain of a tooth. Pray God keep you from my offence
and the punishment of it. I do not mean that you
should be void of anxiety in times of hazard, but offer
them to God every night and sleep in peace, the same
every morning, and rise with confidence.... I am
much pleased with his Majesty’s confidence in Mr.
Boscawen....</p>

<p>“All I can gather of this most shameful affair is that
there will be no more known till there is a publick

might have made more of it, I suppose they will....
It will be defered (the enquiry, I mean) till the sitting
of parliament. Sir J. Mordaunt and Admiral Hawke
have both been to Court, the Admiral was received
graciously, the other taken no notice of, ’tis said he
stooped to kiss the royal hand, but it was pulled back
from him; wou’d it not have been more kingly to have
forbidden his coming? ’Tis said soon after some of the
troops were in the boats in order to land; there was a
council of war called, and when Hawke thought they
were landed, they were ordered on board again; ’tis
certain there were 5 or 6 days spent on councils of
war, and then Hawke, who was not concerned in them,
desired them to come to some resolution, for he wou’d
either land them or return home. Colonel Conway, I
hear, showed the most spirit, and that our commen men
showed no unwillingness to action.... The Duke
came thro’ the city on Thursday at four in the afternoon.
I saw some who saw him, there was no sort of
notice taken of him; I think he was well off. I suppose
you have seen the King of Prussia’s letter to our King,
’tis denyed but believed to be genuine. I think your

<p>Mr. Montagu, writing from Sandleford on November
6, to his wife, mentions Hawke being sent out again
with Boscawen, “was a clear proof that they had nothing
to impute to him which was faulty.” He was busy
planting at Sandleford, and said he must get chestnuts
and acorns when he came to London, as the last sown
had been rotten, “according to Millar the way of trying

been a nervous fever, with weakness and loss of appetite.
Of Dr. Monsey she says, “He has given me as much
attendance as if I was a Princess of the blood, tho’ I
have never given him a fee.” Dr. Shaw had been called
off to the Duchess of Newcastle at Claremont, who was
suffering in the same way. Great discussion is given
as to giving of the “bark” without danger, and when to
do so. “Dr. Shaw has had six guineas of me, I shall
give him no more, I had difficulty to make him accept
the last, but he attended me at first twice a day.” The
Mordaunt affair is alluded to in each letter. In one
occurs the following—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lord Chesterfield in a letter from Bath to Lady
Allen writes thus: ‘Your ladyship may believe all the

Mr. Boscawen to supply the loss of the <i>Invincible</i>. I

</div>

<p>The Delany trial had lasted for nearly ten years.
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_124">[124]</span>It was on account of Dr. Delany, in inadvertence, having
burnt a paper of importance belonging to his first wife.
Sometimes it appeared to be at an end, but it was as
often renewed. At last, on March 5, Lord Mansfield,<a id="2_FNanchor_180" href="#2_Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
after an hour and a half’s speech, decided in favour of
Delany. The cost of the suit exceeded the disputed
sum, but the relief to the good dean and his wife on its
decision balanced everything.</p>

to you, yet I have the boldness to write. I have been
over a great variety of the world, and have seen much
people, but I wanted to see men; for the Design of my
Travel was knowledge, and I thought knowledge of real
men was better than books, therefore I have turned my
Eyes upon all ways and at last had the great happyness
of seeing and hearing you in that potent House of
Commons, and there I discovered like the light breaking
upon me, what my Friends had often told me, of your
great love to your Country and your wise Eloquence
that conquers more than the Sword of a Hero. I own
I grew a little envious; for I thought no man loved his
country better than I have mine, but I confess it that I
am nothing, tho’ I have been sailor, porter, slave, and
suffered everything in every shape, to make my country
what you have made yours. This is my small merit and
the only recommendation I can make to you. Sir, I will
observe that a cloudy day in winter is light enough to
see what is about us and to serve common business, but
permitt me to say no man is happy nor in good spirit
untill the sun shines out. Then there is joy upon all
men’s faces. Thus it is, great Sir, with me in this
country, I along with the rest in this happy land, find
Benefit of the Light you give us all by your great
wisdom of governing, but I am not happy, and my Life
is dead untill I see the Vezirazam of England.</p>

<p>“If you do me this high Honour, you will see a poor
soldier whose only Fortune is a character with all people
which I have been amongst. I was a Porter for learning
not for livlihood, and I was honest in that low way.
This is known when by the goodness of great Souls I
was raised from that. I was not idle nor ingreatefull;
I have been high and low and I was not bad. When
I served the last campaign in Germany, all the officers,
both English and the German, will say more of me than
I dare think of myself. I have, Sir, in my studies for
my country, found the way to advance it, and do some<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_126">[126]</span>
service to your noble Nation at the same time. My
humble plan for this good design I will do myself the
Honour to show to you and be instructed by your great
Wisdom and to give me new rights in this great matter.
My scheme has two Qualities which make some laugh at
me, others seem to like me for it. Whatever it is, it is
little without your assistance. If you approve of it, I
laugh at those that laugh at me, at any rate I am
resolved and nothing shall stop me but Death, which is
common to everybody, and an honest Heart need not fear
any. I am, with the greatest Respect and Veneration,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So much for war and war’s alarms; as to our civil
occurences, they have been so boisterously carried I
need not change the tone of my narrative; the Judges,
the Lord Keeper, the Chief Justice, and the late Lord
Chancellor gave their opinions against the Habeas
Corpus bill.<a id="2_FNanchor_184" href="#2_Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Lord Temple, much in wrath, insulted
the Judges in some of his questions; Lord Lyttelton
warmly and sharply reproved him upon which words
rose high, the House of Lords interfered. The last day
of this bill, Lord Mansfield and Lord Hardwicke<a id="2_FNanchor_185" href="#2_Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> spoke
so full to the matter, even Tory Lords, and these most
violent in their wishes for it, declared they were convinced
the new bill was dangerous to liberty in many
respects, in many absurd; so that had there been a
division there would not have been four votes for it, but
Mr. Pitt’s Party discreetly avoided a division. This
affair has not set the legislative wisdom of the House of
Commons in a very high light, but the great Mr. Beckford,<a id="2_FNanchor_186" href="#2_Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
whom no argument can convince, no defeat make
ashamed, nor mistake make diffident, did on the motion
for a vote of credit stand up in the House of Commons
and say he would not oppose that measure, as he had
an opinion of the two Commoners in the administration,
but in the Peers that composed it, he had no confidence,
and ran in foul abuse of them and then ended with a
severe censure of the House of Lords in general. Lord
Royston<a id="2_FNanchor_187" href="#2_Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> answered him that this was unparliamentary<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_128">[128]</span>
where personal, and indecent in regard to the House of
Peers in general, to which Mr. Pitt answered with great
heat that he was sorry to hear such language from a
gentleman who was to be a Peer; he set forth the great
importance and dignity of Mr. Beckford personally, and
above all the dignity and importance of an alderman,
concluding it was a title he should be more proud of
than that of a Peer. This speech has enraged the Lords,
offended the Commons, and the City ungratefully say
was too gross. Those who wish well to this country,
and consequently to a union of parties at this juncture,
are sorry for these heats; it is well if they do not unsolder
the Union.... I began Islington Waters to-day....

<div class="sidenote">JOHN ROGERS — ROGERS’ WILL</div>

<p>Mention has been made of Mr. John Rogers, first
cousin on his mother’s side to Mr. Montagu, also of Mr.
Montagu becoming his trustee in 1746, when he was
pronounced a lunatic. At first it seems that he
suffered from epileptic fits, which increased to lunacy,
but of a mild order. On June 23 Mr. Edward Steuart
wrote to say Mr. Rogers was seriously ill, and his
death expected hourly; he was being attended by Dr.
Askew, then a famous north-country doctor, and several
surgeons, for a mortification in his leg.<a id="2_FNanchor_189" href="#2_Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> On the 24th he
expired, in his seventy-fourth year, at his house in Pilgrim
Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne. Mr. Montagu was his
principal heir. Mrs. Montagu, in a letter respecting the
estate of East Denton, etc., wrote in later days, “Mr. M.<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_129">[129]</span>
has half the estate by descent, a share by testamentary
disposition, and a part by purchase.” Mr. Rogers’
lunacy seems to have been made worse by the death
of his wife, Anne Delaval, daughter of Sir John Delaval,
whom he married in 1713, and who died in 1722–23.
His will was made in 1711, and a codicil added 1715,
in which he left his property, after the death of his
mother, Mrs. Elizabeth Rogers, to his wife, and failing
issue by her, to the Montagus and Creaghs, all first
cousins. Mary Creagh had married Dominick Archdeacon,
and her sister Margaret, Anthony Isaacson; Mr.
Montagu’s two brothers, Crewe and John, being dead,
the only other heir was Jemima, Mrs. Medows, afterwards
Lady Medows. The estates were very large;
besides Denton, with its coal-mines, houses in Newcastle,
and in Bramston, Lamesley, Harburn, Parkhead, and
Jarrow, in the county of Durham; lands at Hindley,
Sugley, Throckley, Newbiggin, Scotswood, etc., etc.;
collieries and saltpans in Cullercoats, Monkseaton,
Whitley, and Hartley, etc., etc. Mrs. Montagu was
at Ealing with the Bothams when the express came.
She writes to her husband, “It gives me pleasure to
think I shall see you with unblemished integrity and
unsoiled with unjust gain, enjoying that affluence many
purchase with the loss of honesty and honour.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ELIZABETH CARTER — MRS. MONTAGU’S LETTER</div>

<p>The next letter is the first I possess to Elizabeth
Carter, whose learned translation of Epictetus was
first printed in April of 1758. Miss Carter, or <i>Mrs.</i>
Carter (as courtesy termed her), was the daughter of a
clergyman, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Nicholas Carter, D.D., Perpetual
Curate of Deal, Kent, where he resided; he had been
twice married, and Elizabeth was his child by his first
marriage. To his children by both marriages Mr. Carter
gave an excellent education, and at an early age Elizabeth
studied Latin, Greek, and eventually Hebrew. She was
a proficient in French, and taught herself Italian, Spanish,
and German; later in life Portuguese and Arabic were
added. Her application to study produced severe headaches,
principally brought on by drinking green tea and
taking snuff to keep herself awake. It appears that
Mrs. Montagu had met her in 1757, but Mrs. Carter had
rather avoided such a brilliant acquaintance, being herself
of a most humble and unambitious character, despite
her learning. From the following portions of Mrs.
Montagu’s letter we learn that Miss Carter had been
paying her a visit:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Hill Street, July 6, 1758.<br>
</p>

<p>“What must my dear Miss Carter think of the signs
of brutal insensibility which I have given in not answering
her obliging letter? As my heart has had no share
in the omission, I have no apologies to make for it; no<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_131">[131]</span>
day has passed since you left us in which I have not
thought of you with esteem and affection; I look upon
my introduction to your acquaintance as one of the
luckiest incidents of my life, if I can contrive to improve
it into friendship; this is, and has been the state of my
mind and I am proud of it: as to my conduct in the
commencement of our correspondence, I am ashamed of
it. I was ill when I received your polite and agreeable
letter. I have ever since been drinking Islington waters,
from which I receive some benefit, but with this inconvenience,
that I am unable to write till late at night, and
even then not without headache. The death of a relation
of Mr. Montagu’s in the North, which happened about a
fortnight ago, with a large accession of fortune, has
brought me the usual accompaniment of riches, a great
deal of business, a great deal of hurry, and a great many
ceremonious engagements. The ordering funeral ceremonies,
putting a large family in mourning, preparing for
a journey of 280 miles, and receiving and paying visits
on this event, has made me the most busy miserable
creature in the world. As the gentleman from whom
Mr. Montagu inherits had been mad above 40 years and
almost bed-ridden the last ten, I had always designed to
be rather pleased and happy when he resigned his unhappy
being and his good estate. I thought in fortune’s
as in folly’s cup, still laughed the bubble joy; but though
this is a bumper, there is not a drop of joy in it, nor so
much as the froth of a little merriment. As soon as I
rise in the morning, my housekeeper with a face full of
care, comes to know what must be packed up for Newcastle;
to her succeeds the Butler, who wants to know
what wine, etc., is to be sent down; to them succeed
men of business and money transactions; then the post
brings twenty letters, which must be considered and
some answered. In about a week we shall set out for
the North, where I am to pass about three months in
the delectable conversation of Stewards and managers
of coal mines, and this by courtesy is called good fortune,
and I am congratulated upon it by every one I meet;
while in truth, like a poor Harlequin in the play, I am
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_132">[132]</span>acting a silly part <i lang="fr">dans l’embarras des richesses</i>. I would
not have troubled you with this detail, but as part of my
defence for not having written to you. I can perfectly
understand why you were afraid of me last year, and
I will tell you, for you won’t tell me; perhaps you have
not told yourself. You had heard I set up as a wit,
and people of real merit and sense hate to converse
with witlings, as rich merchant-ships dread to engage
privateers, they may receive damage and can get nothing
but dry blows. I am happy you have found out I am
not to be feared; I am afraid I must improve myself
much before you will find I am to be loved. If you will
give affection for affection <i lang="fr">tout simple</i> I shall get it from
you....”</p>

<p>Mention is made of Emin’s joining the King of

through Lord Lyttelton.</p>

<p>“I have the pleasure of hearing infinite commendations

Some praises I heard a few days ago at the Bishop of

<div class="sidenote">LORD LYTTELTON TO DR. MONSEY</div>

<p>A most amusing letter from Lord Lyttelton to Dr.
Monsey of July 24 now occurs, in which he returns a
letter of Mrs. Montagu’s to the doctor, and summons
him to a duel of words in her praise on Hagley turf.
He teases Dr. Monsey with the idea of her going north,
and advises him “to quit Lord Godolphin to follow
love, follow him over the Cheviot Hills and down to
the coal-pits at Newcastle.” After a great deal of chaff
it ends, “Your most affectionate, humble Servant,—<span class="smcap">Lyttelton</span>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. MONTAGU’S SYMPTOMS</div>

<p>This frightened Monsey, so on July 30 he writes<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_133">[133]</span>
from St. James’s and gives her strings of advice as to
her health.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know the generality of Physicians will be cautious
of blooding you, as being what is called nervous; I know
nothing of nerves in the usual sense of the word, if indeed
it has any precise meaning at all, it is used by the
wise to quiet fools, and by fools to cover ignorance.”
Then he adds in high fever she may be blooded, “5, 6 or 7
ounces, and if you flag a blister! will set matters to right.
I say nothing of vomits, you can’t bear ’em, but you will
gentle purging, your lemon mixture and contrayserva
with a little saffron, be cautious of hot medicines, but
do not wholly throw them away, as to spasms and
cramps they are such Proteuses, one does not know
how to catch or hold them, Valerian and Castor are in
such reputation for vanquishing those Hussars.... Assafœtida
you can’t bear, I wish you cou’d ... if feverish
3 spoonfuls of a decoction of the bark by boyling one
ounce and half in a quart of water to a pint, and if your
stomach flags put in from 5 to 10 drops of Elixir of
Vitriol, so arm’d a common cold will not have courage
to attack you.”</p>
</div>

<p>Finally he consigns her to a Dr. Ramsay’s care, should
she require a physician!</p>

<p>On August 1 Mrs. Boscawen wrote from Hatchlands
a long letter describing a visit to London. Her letters
are sprightly, but too much larded with French words
and phrases; the end is interesting—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i lang="fr">Enfin</i> we left this dear odious London at 4 in the
afternoon, <i lang="fr">chemin faisant</i> I thought within myself, what
if I should meet an express from America, and sure
enough upon Cobham Common I met a post-chaise containing
an officer, on him I star’d attentively, he star’d
again; then he cry’d ‘Stop,’ I echoed ‘Stop,’ <i lang="fr">enfin</i> I heard<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_134">[134]</span>
him ask ‘is Admiral Boscawen’s<a id="2_FNanchor_193" href="#2_Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> lady in that coach?’
I make quick reply in the affirmative, and soon he produced
himself at my coach window, and told me he was
express sent by the Governor of Nova Scotia with news
of our troops having taken the Forts of Beau Sejour and
Chignecto, that he attended Admiral Boscawen for his
orders twenty-three days ago, and left him in perfect
health; he added that Admiral Boscawen had saved
North America, where all our Colonies were in the
utmost danger, as well as consternation till he came.
Papers having been found which showed the French
had a design to destroy Halifax, where the people
imagin’d the French wou’d let in the Indians to massacre
them.... He added, ‘Mr. Boscawen had taken, or as
the phrase there is <em>detain’d</em>, six French merchant ships,
and had blocaded Louisbourg.’”</p>
</div>

<p>She adds that her letters from her husband were with
Mr. Cunninghame (the Officer), addressed to Mr. Cleveland,
so she let them go, and sent on her black servant
“Tom” next day to fetch them, and was going to Portsmouth

<div class="sidenote">ON THE WAY NORTHWARDS</div>

<p>To return to the Montagus, they set out on August 1
for the North, and the first letter is from her to Lord
Lyttelton on August 6, from Darlington—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am now about 25 miles short of Newcastle, having
travelled above 250 miles since last Tuesday, and am
better to-night than I was when I left London, so I will
no longer endure that Dr. Monsey shall call me flimsy
animal, puny insect, and such opprobrious names. I
have had a surfeit of being in a post-chaise, that I have
not made many excursions to see the fine places that
lay in the road. In my way to Nottingham I went to see<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_135">[135]</span>
Sir Robert Clifton’s,<a id="2_FNanchor_194" href="#2_Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> which appears to me for beauty
of prospect equal to any place I ever saw. You are led
to it from the turnpike road by a fine terrace on the side
of the Trent. From a pavillion in the garden you see
the town and Castle of Nottingham standing in the most
smiling valley imaginable, in which the Trent serpentizes
in a most beautiful manner.... I return your Lordship
many thanks for having lent me so agreeable a companion
as Antonio de Solis.”<a id="2_FNanchor_195" href="#2_Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MARY WEST</div>

<p>To this Lord Lyttelton writes from Hagley on
August 17, to say how glad he is she bore the journey
so well, and the book entertained her. He had been
drinking the waters at Sunning Hill, Berks, and found
benefit. In the end of a long letter he writes, “Miss
West and Captain<a id="2_FNanchor_196" href="#2_Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Hood will be as happy next
Monday as mutual love can make them.” Miss West
was Gilbert West’s sister, and her future husband,
Captain Hood, became afterwards first Viscount Bridport.
Mary West lived till 1786, but had no children.
Lord Lyttelton alludes to her not being very young
and “having no time to lose.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a id="2_Footnote_196" href="#2_FNanchor_196" class="label">[196]</a> He became the celebrated Admiral Hood.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In another letter of August 22, written from Lindridge
Vicarage, Worcestershire, where the Vicar, Mr. Meadowcourt,
was a great friend of his Lordship’s, he writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tom and I came this afternoon to this sweet abode
on our way to Hampton Court.... I told you in my
last that Miss West was to be married to Captain Hood.
Yesterday I had the pleasure to give her away to him at
Hagley Church, after which we made a party to Mr.
Shenstone’s<a id="2_FNanchor_197" href="#2_Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Arcadian Farm in very fine weather. The<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_136">[136]</span>
pastoral scene seemed to suit the occasion, and the bride
owned to me that the cascades and rills never murmured
so sweetly before.... The Dean<a id="2_FNanchor_198" href="#2_Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> came to Hagley just
time enough to give Hood and her the Nuptial Benediction.”</p>

<p>Further on, alluding to Mr. Montagu’s going north
to take possession of the Rogers’ estate, he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I suppose this will find you, like Guyon in Mammon’s
Cave, got down the bottom of your mines,<a id="2_FNanchor_199" href="#2_Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and beholding
your treasures with all the indifference that the
Knight of temperance showed when the Demon of Riches
revealed to him his hidden wealth. I paint to myself
the wonder and admiration of the subterraneous inhabitants
when you first came among them. Since the time
that Proserpina was carried by her husband to his
Stygian Empire, the infernal regions have not seen such
a charming goddess. But is it sure they will let you
return again to daylight? Upon my word I am afraid
you are in some danger, as the Habeas Corpus Bill was
thrown out; for all the women of the upper world will
make interest with the Judges to let you stay there. Yet I
verily think Baron Smith will release you in spite of
them all, and even if he should fail, you have still a
resource, Emin shall come back and deliver you from
the Shades as Hercules did Alcestis.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT CARVILLE — “HURRYS AND CEREMONIES”</div>

<p>The best description of the Montagus’ arrival in the
north is contained in a letter to Dr. Stillingfleet at
“Robert Price’s, <abbr title="Esquire">Esqre.</abbr>, Herefordshire,” sent open to Dr.
Monsey, who forwards it with a few words of his own.
It is dated, “Carville, ye 22nd day of August.” Carville
Hall had been hired by them; it was situated at the end
of the Roman Wall, called Wallsend. Portions of the
letter I give—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I desired Dr. Monsey to acquaint you with the
death of Mr. Rogers. Many letters were to be written
in order to procure him most pompous funeral obsequies,
according to the fashion of Northumberland, as he was
allied to the people of the first rank in the county, and
they were all to be at the funeral.... The 7th of
August at noon we got to Durham, and there began
hurrys and ceremonies that have continued to this day,
and I know not when I shall see a quiet hour. At
Durham we were met by a great number of Mr. Rogers’
relations, and the Receivers and Agents of his estate,
who attended in great form till we got to Newcastle,
where we were to stay two or three days, with a relation
of Mr. Montagu’s till our house was aired. We had not
been an hour at Newcastle before we had the compliments
of the principal persons of the Corporation and
in the town. The next morning visits began.... We
had fifteen people to dine here on Sunday, a family
yesterday, people about business to-day, and three
families to dine here to-morrow; in the morning I am
up to the elbows in dusty parchments and accounts,
after dinner as busy as an hostess of an Inn attending
her guests, at night as sick as an invalid in Hospital,
and these are the woes of wealth, and I am not <i lang="fr">une
malade imaginaire</i>.... Mr. Rogers’ family Mansion<a id="2_FNanchor_200" href="#2_Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
having been uninhabited many years, was not fit for our
reception, his house<a id="2_FNanchor_201" href="#2_Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> in Newcastle was not agreeably
situated for the summer, so we hired a house on the
banks of the Tyne for the occasion. It is a very pretty
house, extreamly well furnished and most agreeably
situated, ships and other vessels from Newcastle are
sailing by every hour. The river here is broad and of a
good colour, and we have a fine reach of it: we have a
very good turnpike road to the sea-side, where I should
pass a great deal of my time if it was not all engross’d
by company, but we are in the midst of the largest
neighbourhood I ever saw, and some of these gentlemen
by means of coal mines have immense fortunes.”</p>

<p>In a letter to her sister, Mrs. Scott, Newcastle is
described.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The town of Newcastle is horrible, like the ways of
thrift it is narrow, dark and dirty, some of the streets so
steep one is forced to put a dragchain on the wheels:
the night I came I thought I was going to the center.
The streets are some of them so narrow, that if the
tallow chandler ostentatiously hangs forth his candles,
you have a chance to sweep them into your lap as you
drive by, and I do not know how it has happened that I
have not yet caught a coach full of red herrings, for we
scrape the Citty wall on which they hang in great abundance.
There are some wide streets and good houses.
Sir Walter Blackett’s seems a noble habitation.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mention is made of the Claverings, Bowes, and Lord
Ravensworth calling.</p>

<p>In a letter of August 25 to Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Montagu
tells her, that <i>en route</i> to Newcastle, she had visited “Althorpe,
the seat of Mr. Spencer, worthy of regard only
on account of a very fine collection of pictures. The
park is planted in a dull uniformity, the ground flatt
(<i>sic</i>), little prospect, has not the advantage of a river or
lake.” After repeating the details of her journey, she
adds that Denton Hall</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="sidenote">ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD</div>

<p>On August 27 Mrs. S. Montagu wrote to young Tom
Lyttelton a long letter describing the country round
Newcastle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After dinner I ferried over the river Wear to
Sunderland, a good sea-port town. They are making a
new pier there, which is done at the expense of the coal-owners,
who have mines near the Wear. I got a very
pleasant walk on the sea-shore; several ships were
sailing out of the harbour fraught only with the comforts
and conveniences of life, they carry out coal and salt and
bring home money. I question whether those who carry
out death and bring home glory are concerned in so
good merchandize, though they account their occupation
more honourable. On Thursday I went to see Lumley
Castle; it is a noble habitation, but so modernized by
sash windows and other fashionable ornaments, I admired
it only as a good house. There are many family
pictures in the Hall, a succession of 16 Lumleys, all
martially accoutred, the Lumley arms on their shields,
their figure and attitudes make them look like scaramouches.
They hang so high I could not read the inscriptions,
but I imagine it is intended one should suppose
each picture was taken from life; but from the
dress and character, I am sure they have been done by
one hand from the genealogical tree. There are many
old pictures in the house, and many fair testimonies of
the ancient nobility of the family, but I cannot pass them
sixteen<a id="2_FNanchor_204" href="#2_Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> generations. There are large plantations of
firs at Lumley Castle, a large park behind the Castle, to<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_140">[140]</span>
the front a good prospect, and the river Wear at a due
distance.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu was connected with the Lumleys, her
cousin, Mrs. Laurence Sterne, being the daughter of the
Rev. Robert Lumley, of Lumley Castle. At the end of
the letter she complains of the tediousness of the post—three
weeks before she had any letters from her
friends!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CAPTURE OF LOUISBURG</div>

<p>This accounts for the news of the taking of Louisburg
on July 27, under Admiral Boscawen, General Amherst,
and Wolfe, not having reached her when she wrote, as
Lord Lyttelton wrote to congratulate her on August 22,
“upon the glorious success of Admiral Boscawen. I
wrote last post to his lady, whom I love for a thousand
good qualities in herself and because she loves you.

Amherst or Wolfe at Fort St. Philips, we had not lost

January 30, 1743–4. His father’s fears as to his attractions
for the fair sex were prophetic.</p>

<p>Tom writes to Mrs. Montagu on September 9,
giving her an account of his travels. Here is a description
of Hampton Court, Herefordshire, the seat of Lady
Coningsby—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The house stands at the end of a line of regular
planted trees, and looks more like a Monastery than a
nobleman’s house. The garden is very large, and would
have been pretty enough if Nature had been left in it
unmolested. In the middle of it is a piece of water of
about an acre, cut into two square lines, in which, to the
astonishment of the beholder, you see Neptune upon his
throne, and twenty Tritons waiting behind him. The
carver has express’d great fierceness in his countenance,
and well may the god who shakes the earth with his
Trident, be angry at being confined in a Pool, which
would scarce hold two hundred fish. From the garden
one might see a noble lawn bounded with an amphitheatre
of wood, was it not for the high Yew Hedges
clipt into a thousand ridiculous shapes which hinder the
eye from passing them, the park, too, is very large, but
so overrun with Bushes that some of the Lawns resemble
bogs.... From my Lady Coningsby’s we went
to my Lord Oxford’s, a place where nature has done a
great deal, which by a little money judiciously laid out
may be made the prettiest <i>ferme ornée</i> in England. My
Lord’s House is a very good one, built in a remarkable
good taste for the times of Queen Anne.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Lyttelton, as usual, adds a few words at the
end of the letter, and congratulates Mrs. Montagu on
the King of Prussia’s “most glorious success, but I am
in pain till I hear what has become of Emin.”</p>

quarter. The Russian infantry as they had
behaved like Bears, fought like Lyons, part of Count
Dohna’s foot gave way, or else it had been a most compleat

anybody but an immortal and invulnerable. He had two

<div class="sidenote">EMIN DISCONSOLATE — THE KING OF PRUSSIA</div>

<p>On September 9 Emin wrote a long letter from the
Duke of Marlborough’s Quarter in Germany, whither
he had retired disconsolate at not being allowed to
fight in the battle by General Yorke, Lady Anson’s<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_143">[143]</span>
brother, to whom he had been recommended by her.
Meanwhile he had marched four days with the Army,
and the King of Prussia had taken notice of him, staring
at him hard and saying to Mr. Mitchell he wished he
had 12,000 men like him. Emin wished he had a letter
to the King, and was furious at General Yorke’s forbidding
him to fight; probably the General was too
anxious for his safety. The following description of
the King of Prussia is so interesting I insert it, the
whole letter to Mrs. Montagu, a folio sheet closely
written, being too long:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will do my endeavour to describe the King of
Prussia’s person, and his way of living. He is no taller
than Emin the Persian, he has a short neck, he has one
of the finest made heads ever I saw in my life, with a
noble forehead; he wears a false wigg, he has very handsome
nose. His eyes are grey, sharp and lively, ready
to pearce one through and through. He likes a man
that looks him in the face when he is talking to him.
He is well made everywhere, with a bend back, not
stupid (<i>sic</i>, stooped?) at all, like many Europeans. His
voice is the sweetest and clearest ever I heard. He takes
a great quantity of Spanish snuff, from his nose down to
the buckles of his shoes or boots is all painted with that
confounded stuff. His hands are as red as paint, as if
he was a painter, grizy all over. He dines commonly
between twelve and one, and drinks a bottle of wine at
his dinner. I was told that he was very unhealthy in
the time of peace, but since this war he has grown healthy,
and left off drinking a great quantity of coffee, which he
did formerly. All the satisfaction that I have, which is
great enough that I have seen Cæsar alive, nay twenty
times greater, he is more like King Solomon, for he
rules his nation by wisdom and understanding.... His
armies are not only disciplined to the use of arms, but
very religious, and say their prayers three times a day:
it is never neglected, even when they are on the march.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_144">[144]</span></p>

<p>Emin winds up with a message of apology to Mr.
Burke at not having written to him from want of time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE</div>

<p>Meanwhile his adored Mrs. Montagu had nearly lost
her life through the carelessness of a maid. It happened
on September 3. Writing to Sarah Scott, she gives this
description—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On this day sennight at 4 in the morn I was seized
with a fainting fit, in which I lay some time, my maids
in their fright let the <i>eau de luce</i> fall into my eye,
nostril and mouth, my eyes were enflamed and nostril,
the mouth and uvula of the throat excoriated. After a
long and cruel struggle for life,<a id="2_FNanchor_209" href="#2_Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> a most sharp contention
with this medicine, I awaken’d to find myself in
this terrible condition. Dr. Askew unhappily lay at
Durham that night, so had no assistance till 2 at noon,
then I was blooded, which abated the inflammation so
far I could articulate. The Doctor told me my safety
depended on frequent gargling and drinking, so for, four
days, I was never a quarter of an hour without doing
so, the spitting was more violent than from a mercurial
salivation.... When I came out of my fit, to see
blood running from eye, nose and mouth drove Mr.
Montagu almost distracted, and I knew not which way
my agonies would end.... Mr. Montagu has shown
on this occasion the most passionate love imaginable.
Dr. Askew has been very careful, and an excellent
apothecary has watched me night and day.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="2_Footnote_209" href="#2_FNanchor_209" class="label">[209]</a> For two days her life was despaired of; for four days she could

</div>
</div>

<p>In a second letter she says, “On the fourth day when
I was able to look up I was surprized at the impression
concern had made on Mr. Montagu, and I should hardly
have known him, he looked 20 years older at least.”</p>

<p>In a letter of Monsey’s we learn <i>eau de luce</i> was
made of strong sal ammoniac and quicklime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LADY BURLINGTON</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu’s sister, now Lady Medows, wrote on<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_145">[145]</span>
September 14 to say her brother-in-law, Sir Philip, had
been nearly killed in the same way by hartshorn. At
the end of the letter she says, “Lady Bath dyed at two
this morning of the Palsy.” This was the wife of
Pulteney, Earl of Bath, soon after this to become one
of Mrs. Montagu’s most intimate friends. Lady Bath’s
maiden name was Maria Gumley, daughter and heiress
of a great glass manufacturer. She had the character
of great penuriousness, and her husband was credited
with the same character, but I hope to show later
that he could be very generous. When the news of
Mrs. Montagu’s accident spread amongst her numerous
friends, many were the letters of condolence and rejoicing
at her safety from Lord Lyttelton and a host of others.
Dr. Monsey had been staying with the Garricks; he was
a great admirer of Mrs. Garrick, whom he often quotes in
his letters. It was whilst staying with them he heard of
it. Both he and Lord Lyttelton were quite frantic at
the risk she had run, and distressed at her fainting fit.
Monsey was suffering from a bad cough, for which,
when staying with Sir John Evelyn at Wooton, he
tried bleeding, cathartics, and syrup of white poppies.
He returned to St. James’s, where Mrs. Garrick
came to sit with him, and cheer him up. In a letter of
his to Mrs. Montagu of September 23, mention is made
of Lady Burlington’s death. “Lady Burlington is dead.
Mrs. G(arrick) gets nothing, but rid of her, and that’s a
great deal, I think. She gives the Duke of D. £3000
per annum ... not a farthing to any one servant, she
had some lived with her 20 or 25 years.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. GARRICK</div>

<p>Lady Burlington, widow of the 3rd Earl, the celebrated
amateur architect, was the daughter of William,
Marquis of Halifax. On Eva Marie Viegel’s<a id="2_FNanchor_210" href="#2_Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> arrival<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_146">[146]</span>
in England from Austria, the Empress Queen, Maria
Theresa, gave her a recommendation to Lady Burlington,
who received her at Burlington House as an inmate. It
is said “La Violette,” as she was called from her exquisite
dancing in the operas, had attracted the Emperor of
Austria’s attention so much as to alarm the Empress,
and that she therefore sought to remove her from
Austria. Lady Burlington strongly objected to Garrick’s
attachment to La Violette, having more ambitious projects
for her <i>protégée</i>, but it was a true love affair from
the beginning even to the end, and not one word could
ever be said against Mrs. Garrick; theirs was indeed
a love match, and after fifteen years of married life
Garrick presented her with a ring on her birthday,
with the most touching love verses. From the
letters, I gather it was Dr. Monsey who brought
Mrs. Montagu into personal intercourse with the
Garricks.</p>

<p>Dr. Monsey was so disturbed at Mrs. Montagu’s
accident that he wrote almost daily to her, and no one
who reads his letters could imagine, however eccentric
he was, that he was a free thinker in religion, as is
asserted in the “<cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>.”
His letters are so long that it is impossible to print
them in full in this book. He had a bad cough and
a sort of vertigo at this time, in the midst of which he
was called to the Earl of Northumberland, who was
desperately ill, whose sufferings Monsey succeeded in
alleviating. In a letter of October 8 we learn that his
birthday and Mrs. Montagu’s were on the same day,
viz. October 2.<a id="2_FNanchor_211" href="#2_Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> He promises in joke to marry Mrs.
Stuart, a widow lady who had nursed Mrs. Montagu

be adopted into our family....” Dr. Monsey’s little

to her in the worst of her illness; he got hold of her
hand and it was with difficulty they could get him to let
it go and separate them.” (Bishop Sherlock was born
in 1678, so was then eighty years of age.) “I went

<div class="sidenote">CARVILLE</div>

<p>Writing on October 20 to Dr. Stillingfleet, who was

says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Carville<a id="2_FNanchor_219" href="#2_Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> is just at the end of the Picts’ Wall, it
makes part of our enclosures, and we have a Roman
Altar in the stables. The din of War has so frightened
the rural Deities that even the long time that has
passed since the Union with Scotland, has not brought
them to make their residence with us. Pan, Ceres,
and Pomona, seem to neglect us; we are under the
domination of the god of mines. There is a great deal
of rich land in this country, but agriculture is ill understood.
The great gain made by several branches of the
coal trade has turned all attention that way. Every
gentleman in the country, from the least to the greatest,
is as solicitous in the pursuit of gain as a tradesman.
The conversation always turns upon money; the
moment you name a man, you are told what he is
worth, the losses he has had, or the profit he has made
by coal mines. As my mind is not naturally set to this
tune, I should often be glad to change it for a song from
one of your Welch Bards.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu, being attacked by a choleraic disorder,
which kept her in her room a week, and being
still very hoarse from the <i>eau de Luce</i>, Mr. Montagu
insisted on her returning to London before himself, so
as to be in reach of Dr. Monsey. On November 6, from
Wexford, she writes to Sarah Scott to inform her she
is returning to London. Mr. Montagu had accompanied
her three days’ journey; he then returned to Carville.
She had left behind the post-chaise, and travelled in
the “body coach, but my horses are so stout I believe
they will perform the journey from Carville to London
in seven days.” <i>En route</i> she picks up Mr. Tom Pitt,<a id="2_FNanchor_224" href="#2_Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_151">[151]</span>
nephew of Miss Pitt and a friend of his, and carries
them to Durham, putting her maid into their post-chaise.
“My gentlemen leave me at Stilton, from
whence they go to Cambridge.” She mentions that
Mr. Montagu had bought all the jewels belonging to
Mr. Rogers for her, “and to-day intimated he should
give me a great purse of old gold which fell to his
share in the division; some of the pieces are curious,
but there will be between £60 to £70 of money that
one may spend with a good conscience.”</p>

bad health, and she had recommended her to take

a nourishing food, and by its quality supplies deficiency
of food.” I believe vipers are still used as medicine in
France, but whether in England I know not; perhaps
“Brusher Mills,”<a id="2_FNanchor_226" href="#2_Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> the famous New Forest snake-catcher,
could inform one; it does not sound inviting! In the

midshipman for Montagu Isaacson,<a id="2_FNanchor_227" href="#2_Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Mr. Montagu’s
cousin, with Admiral Boscawen. The Admiral had
been most graciously received by the King, “and
nothing can exceed the honours the Admiral meets
with from all quarters.”</p>

horses, she says she shall send three to Sandleford,

<p>“Mr. Pitt opened the session on Tuesday with a very

things had taken of late had put him in good humour, so
that he was willing to give two millions towards the
war on the Continent; he thought it too little to be of
service, but rather more than could be got. Mr. Pitt
answered the sum must not be limited, a great deal
indeed would be wanted, he knew not how it would be
raised, for he did not concern himself with Treasury
business, but the honourable gentleman, signifying Mr.
Legge, understood these matters, and he did not doubt
would raise a proper sum. Poor Legge looked distressed.
No one knows how these great sums are to
be raised, taxes on Dogs and publick diversions are
talked of, the King is much pleased with his Secretary’s
declaration of a support of the continent interest at any
rate. I hear Mr. Pitt’s speech was much admired, and
nowhere more than at St. James’s.... Mr. Pitt has a

Holland where the Armenians have promised to assist
his schemes. Lady Yarmouth has him with her in a
morning and promises him her interest with a very
great man; Lord Northumberland, Lord Anson, and
General York are to be his advocates with Mr. Pitt.
He is an astonishing creature to take thus with all kinds
of people. He hopes to go home in January in a sort of
public character. He is full of anecdotes of the King of
Prussia. He says his eyes and forehead are just like
mine, and he is as particular in his description of him as
a portrait painter would be. He marched with him
seven days, the Prussian Hero is as easy and familiar as
a private man, knowing his character will give him more
respect than his rank: it is not advisable in general for
Princes to lay aside their rank lest they should not
otherwise gain respect, but a truly great man is above
all respect that is not personal.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD ARRAN DEAD</div>

<p>On December 17 the Earl of Arran died; he had
married Mr. Montagu’s relation, Elizabeth, daughter
of Lord Crewe of Stene, who brought him a large
fortune. It was an unhappy marriage, and Mrs. Montagu
hints that, had Lady Arran treated her husband as
he deserved, her money would have come to Mr. Montagu
and Lady Mary Gregory. He died at eighty-eight.
His sister, Lady Emily Butler,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Mr. Boscawen yesterday show’d us a box of horrid implements
with which the French cannon was charged at
Louisbourg, rusty locks, pieces of pokers, curling tongs,
nails in abundance and all sorts of iron instruments,
and this not for want of ammunition, but wanton cruelty.
He found the cannons loaded with these as well as ball.
General Wolfe had a gridiron shot at him; it fell short

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am now reading a very ingenious, pernicious
French author, his name is Helvetius,<a id="2_FNanchor_236" href="#2_Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> a descendant
of the famous Helvetius;<a id="2_FNanchor_237" href="#2_Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> he is a man of fortune in
France, very amiable in his private character, good-natured,
liberal and witty, so has many disciples at
Paris from respect to his person; I fear he will have
many here from respect to his doctrines well adapted
to the corruptions of the human heart. He endeavours
to show it is custom makes virtue and vice, like Epicurus,
placing his good in pleasure but not his pleasure in
good. He thinks a less strict observation of some
moral rules would make man in general happier. He
would trust everything to laws, Legislature is to be the
god and conscience of mankind. He does not consider
how many by their situation are above laws, how many
one may say are below it, and how many more by
fraud, evasions, concealment would hope to escape it.
I hope conscience, call’d by Mr. Pope ‘the god within
the mind,’ will keep her empire in spite of Mr. Helvetius....
The church has obliged him to a retractation,
which indeed may in some measure mortify the author
but will not alter the argument of his book.... Lord

from jealousy, but people now think there was more
of ambition than jealousy in it. The Marquis of
Tavora’s family had a nearer claim to the crown than
that Duke of Braganza who got it, but not being

<p>Soon after this letter, Mrs. Carter paid her first visit

much troubled by the severe illness of Miss Talbot,
her bosom friend, and of Archbishop Secker, with
whom the Talbots lived. Mrs. Montagu, writing to
condole about this, mentions that Lord Waldegrave<a id="2_FNanchor_244" href="#2_Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
was going to marry the illegitimate daughter of Sir
Edward Walpole, and she continues—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Miss Kitty Fisher modestly asked Earl Pembroke<a id="2_FNanchor_245" href="#2_Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>

a woman of talent and literary attainments, who had been
a constant companion of his late wife. Her eyes being
affected with an incurable cataract, she became blind,
and Dr. Johnson was trying to raise money enough
to buy an annuity for her. In 1766 she became a
permanent inmate of Johnson’s house, and on Mr.
Montagu’s death in 1775, Mrs. Montagu settled £10 per
annum on her.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson’s writing is singularly clear, and, once

<p>On June 9 also, Emin wrote on board the <i>Prince
Edward</i>, from the Mole of Genoa, where they were in
quarantine. The letter begins, “To the most learned
and most magnanimous Mrs. Montagu.” He was on his
way to see Prince Heraclius with letters of recommendation
from his father and all the principal Armenians
of Calcutta and India to the Prince and the Archbishop
of Armenia. At last his transcendent merit as a leader
had been acknowledged by his own countrymen, who
now designated him “their chief, their Shepherd and
Protector.” Emin’s affectionate heart was rent at the
thought of parting with his kind English protectors,
and in this letter he says he was almost glad when he
found most of them out or away from home when he
called to bid adieu. He was to cross Turkey by land
to get to Armenia, a most dangerous Journey, and on
the way out two ships had chased them for four or five
hours off Spain.</p>

affliction, added to the terrible lunacy of her husband.<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_163">[163]</span>

<p>“I conducted Mrs. Pitt to Maidenhead Bridge on

not get permission from Mr. Montagu to stay a day or
two, but had barely leave for a dining visit; to my great
mortification, my Landlord at the Bridge told me that
to go by Marlow would carry me 8 or 9 miles out of the
Road, so I gave up my scheme, but met Mr. Amyand,<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_164">[164]</span>
who was travelling through Maidenhead town: he
jumped out of his post-chaise, got into the coach to tell
me all the news of the town, and on my complaining
of my disappointment in regard to Mrs. Clayton, he
assured me if I would go two miles out of my road I
should find myself on the bank of the river opposite
Mrs. Clayton’s house, that then I might go on board a
flat-bottom’d boat and invade her territories. I followed
his directions, but as my coach could not pass the river,
I proposed only to drink a dish of Chocolate, walk
round her gardens, and proceed to Reading. She
kindly desired to carry me thither early in the afternoon,
said she would get Mrs. Southwell<a id="2_FNanchor_250" href="#2_Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> of the party,
that my coach should go on to Reading and I should
find my horses refreshed and ready to set forward for
Sandleford: no magical wand could have made a metamorphosis
more to my advantage than converting the
rose Parlour at the Inn in Reading into an elegant

and Mrs. Southwell; and an empty coach into one filled

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The necessity the French will be under of restoring
their army in Germany by large reinforcements must,
I think, putt an end to their intended invasion, and
you Ladies of Britain will not be exposed to the outrages
and brutalities which the poor Ladies of Hildesheim
have suffered from the rage of those polished barbarians....
I had writt thus far at Taymouth, Lord Breadalbane’s
fine seat, but was forced by some interruption to delay
ending my letter till I came to Inverary, from whence I
now write. The House deserves to be call’d, as it was
stil’d by Lord Leicester, ‘the Royall Palace of the King
of the Goths.’ He reigns here in great state, but Nature
reigns in still greater. I have scarce ever seen her more
sublimely majestick; nor does she want some sweet
graces to soften her dignity and make it more amiable.
As the Duke of Argyll<a id="2_FNanchor_253" href="#2_Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> is one of your admirers, and, I
think, a favoured one too, you ought to make him a<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_166">[166]</span>

<div class="sidenote">ALNWICK</div>

<p>Tom Lyttelton, who was travelling with his father
in Scotland, writes on September 10 from Edinburgh to
Mrs. Montagu. Some portions of his letter I copy—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The first place I shall mention to you is Alnwick,
the seat of the Earl of Northumberland. The Castle is
very gracious, and stands on the brow of a hill; it was
formerly very strong. His Lordship has shown great
judgment in the manner of fitting it up, for instead of
using the modern stile of architecture (as Mr. Lumley
has done at Lumley Castle), he has left it for the
most part as it was in Harry Percy’s time, with this
difference, that two or three rooms which were before
ill proportioned and quite unfurnished, are now much
enlarged and fitted very handsomely in the Gothick stile.
He will add many more rooms on the other side of the
court, and will make it in time a very good house, still
preserving its original character. From thence we went
to Berwick to Sir Hugh Dalrymple’s.... The Bass
Island is all a vast Rock broken into many rough and
irregular pieces; it is inaccessible to very large ships,
there is but one place where a boat may safely land; in
the middle of the ascent there are still the remains of an
old castle, which was a state prison with houses for
soldiers built in the rock; they tell you that within these
sixty years it was garrisoned, but it is now become the
habitation only of an infinite number of sea birds, of
which the Solan goose is the most remarkable.... We
went to dine with Mr. Charters, and from thence the
same night reached Edinburgh, and were lodged in the
Royal Palace called <i>Holy Rood House</i>.... My next shall
be from Bishops Auckland (a seat of the Bishop of
Durham’s)....”</p>
</div>

<p>As usual, Lord Lyttelton adds a postscript, and in
it says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_167">[167]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We dined to-day with the Magistrates and corporation
of Edinburgh, and supped with the Duke of Argyll,
who honoured me with his presence at the dinner, a distinction
he never paid to any other than upon this occasion.
Tom and I had our freedoms given us, as we have
had from many other towns with as great compliments
as if I had been a minister of State, or the Head of a
faction.”</p>
</div>

<p>Young Edward Wortley Montagu writes on September
13 to Mr. Montagu from “Mrs. Lyster’s in Hyde
Street, Bloomsbury Market,” to say—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am really greatly concern’d that it has hitherto
been out of my power to wait upon you, and I am
afraid will be so the whole summer, for my book is
sold off, and Millar presses me for a second edition,
which I am now about, and since I wish it should
appear in the world as perfect as possible, I must beg
the favour of you to let me know what corrections you
think it may want; the world received the first edition
with great indulgence, but the second will have a right
to approbation when it has received a greater degree
of perfection from the corrections of a gentleman of
your abilities.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">YORK</div>

<p>In an answer to Lord Lyttelton’s letter from Inverary,
too long to be inserted, Mrs. Montagu mentions that she
is sending the letter to York—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall be glad to hear that your Lordship and Mr.
Lyttelton like York, to which perhaps I am partial as to
the place of my nativity. One of the strongest pictures
in my mind is the funeral of a Dean of York, which
I saw performed with great solemnity in the Cathedral
when I was about 4 years old.... I know, my lord,
you will rejoice with me for Mr. Boscawen’s<a id="2_FNanchor_254" href="#2_Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> victory,
both from public spirit and private friendship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_168">[168]</span></p>

<p>Emin, after a serious illness, was setting off on his
dangerous journey through Turkey, and on September 20
wrote “To the Montagu the Great,” ending up with,
“My dearest, brightest and the wisest Queen of the East,
your very affectionate and faithful, obedient, humble
servant and soldier, Emin of Hasnasari in Persia.”</p>

<p>Lord Lyttelton and his son travelled from Edinburgh
to Lord Hopetoun’s place, Hopetoun House. In a
letter to Mrs. Montagu of September 21, Tom says,
“There is one chimney piece done by Risback that
cost £600, my father thinks it the finest he ever saw.”
Thence they proceeded to Stirling, and paid visits to
Lord Cathcart and Lord Kinnoull; thence to Glamis
Castle, which he describes “as a very old castle, but
has not a tolerable apartment, and can never be altered
much for the better.” He does not mention the ghost;
probably he was not told about it. From thence to the
Duke of Athole’s at Dunkeld, where he is enraptured
with the country, and mentions the window at the
Hermitage,<a id="2_FNanchor_255" href="#2_Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> “through which the falls of the Braan
appear as a surprise to the visitor.” The Lytteltons
accompanied the duke to his other seat, Blair Athole,
after which they proceeded to Taymouth, Lord Breadalbane’s
splendid place, which enchanted Tom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCOTCH CHARACTERISTICS</div>

<p>He now gives Mrs. Montagu a sort of character
sketch of the Scottish nobility—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The characteristical virtues of the Scotch are courage,
temperance, prudence, economy and hospitality. This
last is not only peculiar to the nobility, but is universally
practised by all kinds of people. <i>Good breeding</i>, though
it cannot be properly styled a virtue, is of the highest
<i>consequence</i> to Society. This the Scotch universally
possess, and there is not in the North such a character
as that of an English country Squire, whose whole life<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_169">[169]</span>
is spent in the laudable customs of hunting, drinking,
swearing and sleeping.... Scotch ladies are very
handsome and very sweet-tempered. It is their general
character to be rather too free of their favours before
marriage; however that may be, they are very chaste
after that ceremony. They breed up their children in a
particular manner, for they are accustomed from their
infancy to go without shoes and stockings, nor in the
coldest weather do their parents permit them to wear a
great-coat; if they are of a puny constitution they die,
if not, they are the better for it all their life.”</p>
</div>

<p>He also remarks that “few of the nobility omit going
to Church on a Sunday, and what is of more importance,
when they are there they do not trifle, but seem seriously
to reflect upon the duty they owe their Maker.” This
description from a boy of fifteen is remarkable, and
throws light upon English manners of that period.
After several other visits, Tom returned to his studies
at Eton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSULSHIP AT MADRID</div>

<p>Next to this comes a letter from Mr. Burke, which,
being the first, is given <i>in extenso</i>. His handwriting is
beautiful and very even, but of a feminine cast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I have now the honour of writing to you for
the first time, and the subject of my letter is an affair
that concerns myself. I should stand in need of many
more apologies than I know how to make both for the
liberty I take and for the occasion of it, if I had not
learned by experience that I give you a pleasure when
I put it in your power to exert your good-nature. I
know it is your foible to carry this principle to an extream,
and one is almost sure of success in any application,
or at least for pardon for having made an improper
one, when we know judiciously to take advantage of a
person’s weak point. I do not know anything else
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_170">[170]</span>which could give me confidence enough to take the
Liberty I am now going to use. The Consulship of
Madrid has been vacant for several months; I am informed
that it is in the gift of Mr. Secretary Pitt, and
that it is valuable. I presume, however, that it is not
an object for a person who has any considerable pretensions,
by its having continued so long vacant, else I
should never have thought of it. My interest is weak,
I have not at all the honour of being known to Mr. Pitt;
nor much to any of his close connections. For which
reason I venture to ask your advice whether I can with
propriety proceed at all in this affair, and if you think
I ought to undertake it, in what manner it would be
proper for me to proceed. If my little suit either in
itself or in the persons through whose hands it must
necessarily pass, should be attended with any circumstances
that may make it disagreeable to you to interfere
in it, I shall take it as a favour equal to that I have
asked, if you will be so good to tell me you can do
nothing in it. I shall think such a declaration a great
mark of your confidence. I am sensible that there are
in all people’s connections many points that may make
a person of delicacy unwilling to ask a favour in some
quarters, and yet more unwilling from the same delicacy
to tell the person for whom it is to be asked that they
have such difficulties. There are undoubtedly many
circumstances of propriety in every person’s situation,
which none can feel properly but themselves. I am
not, however, if I know myself, one of those expectants
who think everything ought to be sacrificed to their
Interest. It occurred to me that a letter from you to
Miss Pitt might be of great service to me. I thought
too of mentioning Mrs. Boscawen. The Admiral has
such great merit with the Ministry and the Nation, that
the want of it will be the more readily overlooked in
any person for whom he may be induced to apply. But
these are crude notions and require the understanding
they are submitted to, to bring them to form and
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_171">[171]</span>dwelt so long upon so indifferent a subject. Your
Patience is almost equal to the rest of your virtues if
you can bear it. I dwell with far more pleasure on my
acknowledgments for what you have done for my
friend<a id="2_FNanchor_256" href="#2_Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> in so obliging and genteel a manner. He has
but just now succeeded after a world of delays, and no
small opposition. He will always retain a very grateful
sense of what you have done in his favour. Mrs.
Burke<a id="2_FNanchor_257" href="#2_Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> desires me to present her respects to you, and
her best wishes for your health. When last I had the
pleasure of seeing Dr. Monsey, he told me that the
country still agreed with you, else I should most
wickedly wish this fine weather over that you might
be the sooner driven to town. This fine weather suffers
nothing good to be in Town but itself. We are much
obliged to the Doctor for the satisfaction he gave you
in uniting his care with yours for Mr. Montagu’s
recovery. I congratulate you very sincerely on that
event. If I could find some agreeable circumstance in
your affairs for congratulation as often as I wish I
should be the most troublesome correspondent in
England, for nobody can be with greater respect and
gratitude,</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENERAL TOWNSHEND — GENERAL WOLFE</div>

<p>In a letter to Lord Lyttelton of October 23, Mrs.
Montagu mentions visiting Lady Townshend to congratulate
her on the taking of Quebec, which had
happened on September 13, and in which her son,
General Townshend, had taken a prominent part. In
this she says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_172">[172]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The encomiums on Mr. Wolfe run very high, a
great action is performed and every one can endure
to give praise to a dead man; and there was certainly
something very captivating in his character; he took
the public opinion by a <i>coup de main</i>, to which it surrenders
more willingly than to a regular siege. The
people had not time to be tired of hearing him called
the brave; he is the subject of all people’s praise, and
I question whether all the Duke of Marlborough’s conquests
gained him greater honour.”</p>
</div>

<p>In answer to this Lord Lyttelton says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wish that a French invasion from Havre de Grace,
which I have particular reasons to be more afraid of
than ever, may not correct the extravagance of our joy
for our unexpected success at Quebec, and the false
security it has produced in the minds of our ministers....
Mr. Bonus, the picture cleaner, has come down and
has restored my old family pictures to such a state of
perfection that I can hardly believe my eyes when I see
them. Few gentlemen, I assure you, have a finer collection
than mine appears to be now. If Lady Coventry
ever comes here, she will cry at the sight of some of
the beauties of Charles the Second’s court, which by
Mr. Bonus’ help exceed hers as much as she does my
milkmaids. There is particularly a Duchess of Richmond
whom you have read of under the name of
Mademoiselle Stuart in the ‘<cite>Memoirs of the Count de
Grammont</cite>,’ whose charms are so divine that my nephew
Pitt is absolutely falling in love with her and does
nothing but gaze upon her from morning till night.
What would you living beauties give if twenty years
hence, when you begin to suffer by time, there could be
found a Mr. Bonus to restore you again, as he has done
this fair lady and others at Hagley? Pray come and
see the miracles of his art....</p>

<p>“Pitt sends his best compliments, and we both agree
you have indeed a great deal of a witch about you, but
nothing of a Hag.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_173">[173]</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Montagu evidently refused to exert her influence
in favour of Mr. Burke’s desire to obtain the
Madrid Consulship, as on October 6 he writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“For many publick as well as private reasons
I am sorry that you have not an influence on Ministers
of State; but the qualities which some persons possess
are by no means those which lead to Ministerial
influence. The reasons you have been pleased to give
me for not making the application are very convincing
and obliging. Before I applied I was well aware of the
difficulties that stood in my way.”</p>
</div>

<p>Further down in the letter (which is not sufficiently
interesting to be given <i>in extenso</i>) he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is not very easy to have access to Mr. Pitt,
especially for me, who have so very few friends. I
mentioned those methods, not that I was satisfied
of their propriety, but because I would try every
method which occurred to me.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“TRISTRAM SHANDY” — THE REV. LAURENCE STERNE</div>

<p>Though undated, the following letter of Laurence
Sterne may be placed here. Early in 1759 he had been
writing the first two volumes of “<cite>Tristram Shandy</cite>,”
towards the end of the year he was in London arranging
for their publication with Dodsley the publisher, who
declined the venture. They were printed for and sold
by John Hinxham, bookseller in Stonegate, according
to <cite>Mr. Traill’s volume on Sterne in the “Englishmen of
Letters” series</cite>. The allusions to the Dean of York,
etc., referred to a dispute between a Dr. Topham and
Dr. Fountayne (Dean of York), in which Sterne sided
with the Dean when he wrote his “<cite>History of a Good
Warm Watchcoat</cite>,” “a sarcastic apologue,” as Mr. Traill<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_175">[175]</span>
terms it. I have not time or knowledge enough to enter
into the details of this affair, but hope the letter may
throw light upon it to students of Sterne’s character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I never was so much at a loss as I find
myself at this instant that I am going to answer the
letter I have had the honour and happiness to receive
from you by Mr. Torriano; being ten times more
oppress’d with the excess of your candour and goodness
than I was before with the subject of my complaint.
It was entirely owing to the Idea I had in common
with all the world of Mrs. Montagu’s that I felt sorrow
at all—or communicated what I felt to my friend; which
last step I should not have taken but from the great
reliance I had upon the excellency of your character.
I wanted mercy—but not sacrifice, and am obliged,
in my turn, to beg pardon of you, which I do from my
soul, for putting you to the pain of excusing, what in
fact was more a misfortune, than a fault, and but a
necessary consequence of a train of Impressions given
to my disadvantage. The Chancellor of York, Dr.
Herring, was, I suppose, the person who interested
himself in the honour of the Dean of York, and requested
that act of friendship to be done to the Dean, by bringing
about a separation betwixt the Dean and myself—the
poor gentleman has been labouring this point many
years—but not out of zeal for the Dean’s character, but
to secure the next residentiaryship to the Dean of St.
Asalph, his son; he was outwitted himself at last,
and has now all the foul play to settle with his conscience
without gaining or being ever likely to gain
his purpose. I take the liberty of enclosing a letter
I wrote last month to the Dean, which will give some
light into my hard measure, and show you that I was
as much a protection to the Dean of York—as he to me.
The answer to this has made me easy with regard to
my views in the Church of York, and as it has cemented
anew the Dean and myself beyond the power of any<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_176">[176]</span>
future breach, I thought it would give you satisfaction
to see how my interests stand, and how much and how
undeserved I have been abused: when you have read
it—it shall never be read more, for reasons your
penetration will see at once.</p>

<p>“I return you thanks for the interest you took in my
wife, and there is not an honest man, who will not do
me the justice to say, I have ever given her the character
of as moral and virtuous a woman as ever God made—what
occasion’d discontent ever betwixt us is now no
more—we have settled accounts to each other’s satisfaction
and honour, and I am persuaded shall end our days
without one word of reproach or even Incivility.</p>

<p>“Mr. Torriano made me happy in acquainting me
that I was to dine with you on Friday; it shall ever be
my care as well as my Principle ever to behave so that
you may have no cause to repent of your goodness
to me.</p>

namely some little mark of kindness or regard to me as
a kinswoman, I meant not such as would have cost her
money, but indeed this neither she or any one of the
Robinsons vouchsafed to do, though they have seen Mr.
Sterne frequently the last two winters, and will the

one thing to merit such neglect was ever so cast off by

was in her power to undo the mischief, though I can’t

there was both letters and conversations pass’d betwixt
them last winter on this subject, and though I was an

Lord Lyttelton from Mrs. Montagu, a portion of which
I copy—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Can I begin the new year more auspiciously than
by dedicating the first hours of the New Year’s Day to
that person from whose friendship I hope to derive so
much of the honour and happiness of every year of my
life? Among the wishes I form for myself, not the least
earnest are those of seeing Lord Lyttelton and his son
enjoy all the health, felicity and fame that can be
attained in this world, with the chearing prospect of a
better state.... The world much admires the Pamphlet,<a id="2_FNanchor_258" href="#2_Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
and Lord Bath does not deny he is the author as I am told.
I ordered Mr. Bower to send it to your Lordship, but it
is out of print.... The Hereditary Prince<a id="2_FNanchor_259" href="#2_Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> is gone to

<p>The next letter of January 15, to the same, is as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My eyes have at last served me to read the collection
of letters which have afforded me much entertainment,
those from the illustrious I consider as written
in their theatrical character, for though they are written
behind the scenes, which gives them an air of reality,
they are made to suit the assumed character. Lord
B(ath) is Patriot and Philosopher, after the manner of
the Ancients, his letters bear a consular and stoical
dignity, and when I expect to see them signed Marcus,
Cato or Caius Cassius, he surprises me with a Christian
name and modern title. Those of another eminent
person appear more natural, though perhaps they are
not more sincere, but the modes we are used to by their
familiarity appear less constrained and artificial.... I
will send Mr. Lyttelton the Gazette extraordinary from
Quebec next post, it is from the Indian Savages, and expressed
in hieroglyphicks; it will give him an idea of
the expresses sent by the Mexicans and Montezuma. I
will send him the explanation with it.... Mr. Stewart
gave me this curious piece this morning.... I did not
say Lord Bath own’d, but that he did not stoutly deny
the pamphlett. Mr. Pitt and his party are angry at it,
and I hear H. Walpole has answer’d it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Tom Lyttelton writes from Eton, March 8, to Mrs.
Montagu, to beg her to write to him. Her eyes had
been very weak lately, and writing was an effort. In
this Tom says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I hear my cousin Pitt is gone abroad with Lord
Kinnoul.... I wish his tour may afford him as much
pleasure as it will improvement. But nothing can ever
hinder a mind like his, active and desirous of knowledge
from improving itself everywhere, but particularly in
foreign countries.... I only wish the eyes of the
handsome Spanish Ladies may not make a greater impression
on his heart than the beautiful Vales of
Arragon and Castile.”</p>

<p>He then alludes to the late attempted assassination
of the king, but his account is too long to copy <i>in
extenso</i>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The story of a conspiracy is universally disbelieved,
the whole is attributed to the malignity of the Duke of

family since the late dreadful execution, which is followed
by the erection of the Bastile, into which people
of the first rank are committed without any cause
assigned, makes them afraid to be even seen with one
another.... I hear my little friend Tom has not forgot
me in my peregrinations, has apprehensions from the

have applied History to its best use, the advantage of
morality; you have exposed vice and folly, but with
so noble a hand, that both fools and knaves must feel
that you would rather correct than execute them. You
have even shown mercy to one who never showed nor
felt it; I mean that disgrace to humanity, that sanguinary
monster of the North, distinguished only by his Barbarism
and his Barbarity, Charles the 12th<a id="2_FNanchor_265" href="#2_Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> of Sweden.<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_182">[182]</span>

a great field left open to you for another and yet
another volume, which nobody can range in so usefully

to recommend to his protection and favour a relation

I believe, has some little employment given him by the
present Deputy Governor, Mr. Moore. My kinsman
was formerly an Officer of the footguards, but being a
man of wit and pleasure, shared the common fate of that
sort of gentleman, and was obliged to leave England
and go to Jamaica, for (I doubt) more than suspicion
of debt. I am assured that he is now quite reformed,

<p><cite>Lord Lyttelton’s “Dialogues of the Dead”</cite> had just

Dialogues 26, 27, 28. Writing to Mrs. Carter, she
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have just received my dear Mrs. Carter’s letter,

With her encouragement I do not know but<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_183">[183]</span>
at last I may become an author in form. It enlarges
the sphere of action and lengthens the short period of
human life. To become universal and lasting is an
ambition which none but great genius’s should indulge;
but to be read by a few, a few years, may be aspired
to.... <cite>The Dialogues</cite>, I mean the three worst, have

<div class="sidenote">EARL FERRERS’ EXECUTION</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu had vainly tried to conceal her part
as joint author of the “<cite>Dialogues</cite>.” Mrs. Donnellan
immediately challenged her as to whether she or Mrs.
Carter had written them, and Mrs. Montagu was fain to
confess Mrs. Carter was not responsible for them. The
fine ladies were much offended at Dialogue 27, between
Mercury and “Mrs. Modish,” a modern fine lady, in
which they were taken off. The authoress was disgusted
at the fine ladies’ conduct in going to the trial
and sentence of Lord Ferrers<a id="2_FNanchor_267" href="#2_Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> for murdering his
steward. She says to Mrs. Carter—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I own the late instance of their going to hear Lord
Ferrers’ sentence particularly provoked me. The
Ladies crowded to the House of Lords to see a wretch
brought, loaded with crime and shame, to the Bar, to
hear sentence of a cruel and ignominious death, which,
considering only this world, casts shame back on his
ancestors and all his succeeding family.”</p>

Mrs. M(orris) Robinson and Sister Montagu in

Montagu in Brother Morris’ postchaise, so went we
to Kensington Church, the neighbours gazing, the
children running, the mob gathering; from Church we
went to Greenwich, where the Bridegroom gave us a
very elegant and splendid dinner: then we walk’d in
Greenwich Park, return’d to the Inn to drink tea, after
tea the Bride and Bridegroom and Mr. Richardson got
into my coach, I carry’d them to Kensington, and there I
left the lovely loving pair.... William smiled and
looked in high beauty as we went, as we return’d he was
grave, angry perhaps, that Phœbus did not gallop apace
his fiery-footed steeds and hasten on the happy hour.
Never was wedding so decent, so orderly, so unlike a
wedding, none of your fulsome fondness, I assure you,
a few fond glances, but not a syllable addressed to each
other. I believe William will behave well, and she is
sensible and good-natured.... I am glad the wedding

Barracks, which took place on June 12. “I had a

peril on Friday, makes me tremble whenever I get
into the machine.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A GENTLEMAN COACHMAN</div>

<p>To this Mr. Montagu replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I am more concerned than j can express at the
peril you were in. I tremble and shudder when j consider
how fatal the consequences might have been if you had
been actually overturned.... I have inquired after the
cause of this unhappy affair, and though Ned says he
cannot say the coachman was drunk, still he had been
at the Ale House, and when he came home said there
was no danger, and that the boys made almost as much
noise as his Mistress. I find he is a lazy, proud, and
what they call a gentleman coachman, and such as j
would very soon get rid of.”</p>
</div>

<p>Ned was the head groom, and Mrs. Montagu proposed
substituting him for the coachman, as he was
honest and sober. To this her husband replies, “I wish
he had more experience, but j should with all that think
j run no great hazard in trusting him, besides he might
practise to go out with the six horses of times when
you did not want him.” To turn a lumbering coach
and six must have been a most intricate affair. Ned
was promoted to be coachman, but only to practise with
the coach and six; “a coachman to a Mr. Lambard, and
afterwards to Captain Pannel’s heir,” was employed
when the coach went out, being then under a job-master,
one Mr. Jarret, and a chaise and pair conveyed Mrs.
Montagu to the Wells.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The gentleman here ordered the place of my danger
to be mended and acquainted me he had done so, and
hoped I should not be frighted away from the balls.</p>

<p>“Sir Roger Twisden inquired much after you and<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_189">[189]</span>
my Father. He stays but a few days here. Lord Bath
was ill again yesterday, he told me he was mortified
that he had never been able to wait on me, but he was
so weak he could not venture to trouble any one with a
visit. I think he is in a bad way, but has a great deal
of witt whenever he is tolerably well. His Lordship, I
know, has been prejudiced in my favour by some of his
friends, who are also friends of mine and Mr. Domville
in particular, which I believe has given him a desire to
be acquainted with me, but I believe he will hardly be
able to make a visit this season, and in London he never
visits any one who does not inhabit a ground floor.
He has still a fine countenance, and those piercing
eyes that denote a mind extraordinarily lively and
penetrating.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF LORD BATH</div>

<p>William Pulteney, Earl of Bath, was born in April,
1684, hence he was at this period turned seventy-six.
He had lost his wife, <i>née</i> Anna Maria Gumley, in 1758.
Mrs. Montagu must have known him in a superficial
society way, as a description of a great rout given by
Lady Bath some years previously is in this book.
But now was to commence that tender intimacy and
affectionate friendship between them that lasted to his
death, and which prompted him, even in the act of
dying, to stagger from his bed and write a few lines
of adieu to her as his last effort—sacred lines which
I possess and treasure! For his political character I
must refer the reader to history, and the “<cite>Dictionary of
National Biography</cite>.” As regards his private character
I cannot do better than quote Elizabeth Carter’s account
of him in “<cite>Memoirs of her Life</cite>.” It was probable that
through Mrs. Carter, who was a great friend of his, he
began to appreciate the manifold charms of Elizabeth
Montagu. This is what Mrs. Carter says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_190">[190]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“None of his friends, I believe, will remember him
longer and very few with equal affection. Indeed,
there was something in his conversation and manners
more engaging than can be described. With all those
talents which had so long rendered him the object of
popular admiration, he had not the least tincture of that
vanity and importance which is too often the consequence
of popular applause. He never took the lead in
conversation, or even assumed that superiority to which
he had a claim, as he was blessed with an exemption
from many of the pains and infirmities of old age; he
had none of its defects. In so many months as I was
continually in his company last year (1763), I do not
recollect a single instance of peevishness the whole
time. His temper always appeared equal. There was
a perpetual flow of vivacity and good humour in his
conversation, and the most attentive politeness in his
behaviour, nor was this the constrained effort of external
and partial good breeding, but the natural turn of
his mind, and operated so uniformly on all occasions
that I never heard him use a harsh or even an uncivil
expression to any of his servants.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">WINNING A COAL MINE</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu had been at Sandleford, where Morris,
his wife, and little boy were spending some time. The
little Morris was a great favourite, and delight to poor
Mr. Montagu, who loved children. He was now preparing
to set off northwards to Northumberland, having
two collieries which he was going to work, or, as the expression
was, to “win,” viz. Leamington and “Denton.”
The first would cost a £1000, the latter, now called
“Montagu’s main,” £5000. He consults his wife about
all this, and adds, “I think j shall not while j live get
rid of the trouble my succession has brought upon me,
and have only one object, who, j hope, will reap the
benefit of all my labour.” This meant his wife. At
Tunbridge his wife, with “all our fine ladies and gentlemen,”
was attending Mr. Ferguson’s lectures on Philosophy.
In a letter of Lord Lyttelton’s he mentions
his brother Richard. “Sir Richard, or rather ‘Duke
Lyttelton’s’<a id="2_FNanchor_276" href="#2_Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Royall villa at Richmond, a finer room I
never saw, and he seems made to sitt in it, with all
the dignity of a gouty Prince. But though I greatly
admired it, I would not have his gout to have his room.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a id="2_Footnote_276" href="#2_FNanchor_276" class="label">[276]</a> He had married the Dowager Duchess of Bridgewater in 1745. She
was second wife to Scroop, 1st Duke of Bridgewater.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>To this letter a long answer is returned by Mrs.
Montagu, and she informs Lord Lyttelton that, despite
her eyes being very weak, she had been reading</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“the new translation of Sophocles.... The <cite>Œdipus
Coloneus</cite> affected me extreamly, and would have done
so more if it had not been for the constant presence of

crowd. I am more than ever averse to the Chorus
because, though the translator tells us the Choruses of<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_192">[192]</span>
Sophocles are less alien to the subject of the Drama,
than those of any other tragedian, yet here they hurt
the interest of it very much.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">LADY HERVEY — HAGLEY PARK</div>

<p>She adds that she has “sent 4 sets of dressing boxes
from hence as your Lordship desired. At the same
time I took the liberty to send on a cheap set of tea-cups
and coffee cups for a Tunbridge faring.” Lord Lyttelton
returns answer, saying, “I dined at Dicky Bateman’s
half gothick, half attick, half chinese and completely
fribble house.” There he met “my old Love, Lady
Hervey,<a id="2_FNanchor_277" href="#2_Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and my new love, Mrs. Hancock<a id="2_FNanchor_278" href="#2_Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> not to mention
Lady Primrose,<a id="2_FNanchor_279" href="#2_Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> for whom I have a great friendship.”

of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr></cite>” by the great Earl of Hardwicke,<a id="2_FNanchor_280" href="#2_Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> too long

was about to be publicly reopened. On August 18 he

urged the reasons which induced me to esteem them
genuine. His Lordship pays great compliment to what
I had said on the subject, answering other parts of my
letter with spirit and gaiety, and at last concludes that,
in spite of 83, without a voice, and with shaking hands,
he had endeavoured to follow my train of thought,

Lord sent them back with a very obliging note to thank
me for them, but express’d his opinion that they were
not genuine. I was a little distress’d by this favour, as
I had not an opportunity to wait on the Bishop before
my journey. I thought to write to him and assume the
air of being his correspondent would have too much
appearance of presumption, and not to thank him for
his note might look like neglect, so I waited till the
season allow’d me to send him some wheatears and to
assure him I wrote only as his poulterer. As it was
natural to take notice of what his Lordship had said
concerning the poems, I ventured with the utmost
deference to give the reasons why I should have believed
them to be genuine and original, and then return’d back
to my character of Poulterer and desir’d his Lordship to
forgive my presumption and order my letter to be put
on the wheatears when roasting to preserve them from
being burnt. I ask pardon for this long story, but it
was necessary as a key to the Bishop’s letter. Your

those who are imploy’d on his affairs. I thought it
right to let your Grace know this, as it appears to me very
singular, as he is now under the protection of privilege.
I know you will be so good as not to mention I told your
Grace this unless it be to Lady Bute, who I should think
had better know this circumstance. I beg my best

<div class="sidenote">DR. YOUNG</div>

<p>On September 19 Mrs. Montagu set out from Hill
Street on her journey to Northumberland, starting in
a postchaise and picking up Ned and her own horses
at Baldock, and so reached Buckden on the same day.
She writes to Mr. Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I call’d on Dr. Young at Welling and staid about
two hours with him, he received me with great
cordiality, and I think appears in better health than
ever I saw him. His house is happily opposite to a<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_200">[200]</span>
church yard, which is to him a fine prospect; he has
taught his imagination to sport with skulls like the
grave-digger in Hamlet. He invited me to stay all
night, and if my impatience to see you had not impell’d
me on, I had been tempted to it. His conversation has
always something in it very delightful; in the first place
it is animated by the warmest benevolence, then his
imagination soars above the material world, some
people would say his conversation is not natural. I
say it is natural of him to be unnatural, that is out of
the ordinary course of things. It would be easier for
him to give you a catalogue of the Stars than an inventory
of the Household furniture he uses every day.
The busy world may say what it pleases, but some men
were made for speculation, metaphysical men, like jars
and flower pots, make good furniture for a cabinet tho’
useless in the kitchen, the pantry and the Dairy.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a fragment of a letter to Lord Lyttelton, Mrs.
Montagu describes her visit to Dr. Young. She had
heard “the Dialogues of the Dead praised to the highest
degree, and with taste and judgment in a most delicate
sense of their moral merits.”</p>

<p>Through Mrs. Montagu, Dr. Monsey sends to Dr.
Young a powder for his rheumatism. From “Hog
Magog” on September 26, Dr. Monsey writes a long
letter to Lord Lyttelton, describing his visit to Tunbridge
to see “dear Amadissa,” meaning Mrs. Montagu. In
it he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It may be new to your Lordship tho’ not strange,
that the Earl of Bath is fall’n desperately in love with
one who seems not insensible of his passion, and I
think ’tis time for you and I to look about us, for an
Earl is better than a Baron or a quack Doctor ... it
is impossible for me to tell your Lordship with what
warmth he talk’d to me about her, and so now there are
3 fools of us. ‘She is the most extraordinary woman<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_201">[201]</span>
in the world’ with a nod of the head and a grave face,
‘she beats a french Duchess with an hard name all to
pieces, upon my word, Doctor, she is——’ ‘Ay, so she
is, my Lord, but neither I nor you know what.’ ‘Suppose
we say angel.’ ‘No,’ says I, ‘Devil, for she leads us all
into temptation.’”</p>
</div>

<p>On receipt of this, Lord Lyttelton wrote to Mrs.
Montagu, and says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wish Lady Hervey<a id="2_FNanchor_289" href="#2_Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> mayn’t poison you for stealing
Lord Bath from her, as for myself, I will not plead
against him as my Rival that I am a younger man (for
that plea you will not regard) but that I am an older
friend. Adieu, inconstant woman, I feel horribly jealous,
but if you won’t love me better, pray love me next to
Lord Bath.”</p>
</div>

<p>He also chaffs her for spoiling Miss Stanley’s chance
of marrying Lord Bath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. BOWES’ FUNERAL — SIR JAMES COLEBROOKE</div>

<p>From Newcastle, on September 26, Mrs. Montagu
writes to her father—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I arrived here last night and had the pleasure
of finding Mr. Montagu very well. He went this morning
to Gibside to attend Mr. Bowes’<a id="2_FNanchor_290" href="#2_Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> funeral obsequies,
which according to the custom of this county are to
be very pompous. Lord Ravensworth, Sir Walter
Blacket and all the gentlemen of Northumberland and
the county of Durham are to be at it, and I fear it will
be late at night before it is over, tho’ they are to set out
about 4 from Gibside to go to the church. My cousin
Rogers’ funeral we had order’d to be as private as
decency would permit, as he had been so long dead to
Society, but even that was attended by 38 gentlemen’s<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_202">[202]</span>
coaches, so I suppose a publick funeral must be three
or four hundred. In the South people live with more
pomp and dye with less. I hope not to outlive all my
vanity, for I have seldom seen a good and never an
agreeable character without it, but I think it should
not survive one, and I should desire not to go to the
grave with all this bustle, not that I should be afraid
any one should say of my funeral, as Pope does of Sir
John Cutler’s—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I love a blaze of wax lights and my friends about my
living person very well, but the torches and the crowd
about my dead body would give me neither light nor
amusement. Sir Walter Blacket call’d here this morning,
and said he hoped to ride in Hyde Park with you about
the 15th of November. I had a very pleasant journey,
for fine weather, like a good-humoured companion,
makes ordinary scenes appear chearfull and pleasant,
but from the time I left Hertfordshire till I got to
Doncaster, the counties I pass’d through were dreary
and barren, but if these prospects in the other counties
were brown, these in Northumberland are bleak, the
people in them a parcel of dirty Savages, so that I
cannot say with the Psalmist that my lot is fallen in
a fair ground, it is some comfort it is in a rich one, as
I shall see its produce at Sir James Colebrooke’s in
Threadneedle Street with great pleasure.... I met
Sir Thomas Clavering just before I got to Darlington;
he desired me to present his best respects to you and
beg your vote and interest, he sets up for the county
of Durham in the room of Mr. Bowes. Mr. Montagu
gives him all his interest. If the Bishop of Durham
should declare for Mr. Shaftoe (a very young man
whose Father formerly served for Durham), Sir Thomas
will be hard press’d. Lord Darlington will support
Mr. Shaftoe, and most people imagine the Bishop of
Durham will do so too. When applied to for Sir<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_203">[203]</span>
Thomas Clavering, he answered he should act as he
found most agreeable to the majority of the county
gentlemen. Now I imagine Bishops as well as women
(both wear petticoats and a character of gentleness)
command while seeming to submit, ‘and win their way
by yielding to the tyde,’ and that my Lord Bishop in a
mild way of suggestion will bring the gentlemen to
that side he likes best, while he persuades them he
follows their inclination. I must say his Lordship is
much beloved from his liberality and affability, which
are fine moral qualities, as to Xian graces, no doubt but
he has them in a higher degree, so that as Prince Palatine
or Bishop he must influence many. The Dean of
Durham is strongly engaged to Sir Thomas, and there
will be a sort of schism in the church.”</p>

<p>The Montagus were residing in Pilgrim Street, at
the town house of the late Mr. Rogers; “an exceeding

grounds thro’ which wound a river.... Now the
Master is dead it is fall’n to the dullest of all dull
Divines, one Stillingfleet, cousin to him you know,
who has not taste enough to live there himself, but
leaves it to a curate. He desires his compliments to
Dr. Gregory, who was staying with the Montagus, and
adds, ‘I am glad the Scotch like my Dialogues.’ He
also desires if the Bishop of Ossory (Richard Pococke)
is with them to send him on to Hagley, and assures
Mrs. Montagu he is very well and grown quite plump.
His thinness was a constant joke with his friends, who
called him nothing but bones, and he contends if weighed
in the balance with Lord Bath, he would be found ‘very
wanting.’ The Devil take him for having so much witt
with so much flesh. He commends his new house

<p>To this Lord Lyttelton replies from Hagley on

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You tell me, good Madonna, that you are grown
<i>as robust as a milkmaid</i>. If you are so, I have no objection
to your going to Balls, Plays or Poppet Shows
if you please every night; but you have sometimes the
spirits of a milkmaid without the strength. However,
I believe Diversions are better for you than too much
reading, and therefore I am not sorry you have no time
to committ excess with your books. If I were to live
with you, I would not trust you in a Library or alone
in your Room but at stated hours with proper Intervals
of exercise and conversation.... I am glad to hear we
shall have another volume of <cite>Highland Poems</cite>. To
stay your stomach (for, as I know, your appetite is
eager towards them), I send you a copy of four of a
later date than the others now printed, and not much
inferior to them in the Natural Beauty and Force of
Description, tho’ not, I think, so bold and sublime.
Being purely descriptive, they could have nothing
dramatic or passionate in them as most of the others
have. But at the end of these you will find some
objections I have as a Chronologist and Historian to
the authenticity of the printed ones which it will be
hard to get over. Yet I am not persuaded myself they
are not genuine, for who can write so now? Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_206">[206]</span>
Rust<a id="2_FNanchor_291" href="#2_Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> was so struck with them, he read them every
morning and evening aloud to the Family as a Chaplain
does Prayers. And the more I consider them, the more I
admire them. I have seen some specimens in a Latin
translation of the Poetry of the two most admired
Welsh Bards, but they don’t in any degree approach
to the greatness and the Beauty of these. I am charmed
with your comparison between the Greek Plays and
Shakespear. He is indeed unequalled in the power
of painting Nature as she is and giving you sometimes
the utmost energy of a Character of a Passion in short
Stroke and Dash of his Pen. I also agree with you that
the moral Reflexions in Shakespear’s Plays are much
more affecting by coming warm from the Heart of the
interested persons, than putt into the mouth of a chorus,
as in the Greek Plays. I am glad you like my favourite
Philoctetes. The faults you find with the Ajax are perfectly
just, yet I feel the grief of that hero when he
returns to his Reason, and especially in the scene
between him and Termessa. Suppose Belisarius had
gone mad with the unjust Disgrace he had suffer’d, and
in his Distraction had done actions which dishonoured
and exposed him to the Ridicule of his enemies, what
a fine subject would it be for a play if he had killed
himself upon recovering the Use of Reason. Setting
aside the poetical Fiction, Ajax is Belisarius, and
Sophocles has painted the horrors of a great mind
so overwhelmed and confounded with shame in a
very masterly manner.... I am glad your three
Dialogues are well liked in Scotland, where the Author
is not known. Those who know you and believe they
are yours are hardly fair judges. Your form and manners
would seduce Apollo himself in his throne of criticism
on Parnassus itself....”</p>

apoplexy, except when a vessel breaks in the brain, is
not so very rapid. People live four or six days or
more, that is, they breathe and have a pulse. The King
died in an instant, and from some strange odd faintnesses
and oppressions upon his breath, I was almost sure ’twas
in his heart or the great vessels near. And upon opening
him, the Aorta, the canal which receives the Blood
directly, was found burst (a very uncommon case), the<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_209">[209]</span>
Duke of Leeds says. I have known and seen it
thickened, cartilaginous (crusty), and ossified, but I
never met with a broken one; however, ’tis a species of
Death he wished for, sudden, and nothing could be more
so than this, for the instant that vessel breaks, the heart
stops for ever and for ever....</p>

mighty dead of his due rites, if one began one’s letter
with any subject but the loss of our sovereign; on which
I condole with your Lordship, in whom the virtue of
Patriotism, and the antequated one of Loyalty still remain.
I know you had that veneration for our late King which
the justice and prudence of his government so well
deserved. With him our laws and liberties were safe;
he possessed in a great degree the confidence of his
people and the respect of foreign governments; and a
certain steadiness of character made him of great consequence
in these unsettled times. During his long reign
we never were subject to the insolence and rapaciousness
of favourites, a grievance of all others most intolerable
when persons born only one’s equals shall by the basest
means perhaps possess themselves of all the strength of
sovereign power, and keep their fellow subjects in a dependance
on illegal authority, which insults while it subjects,
and is more grievous to the spirits than even to the
fortunes of free-born men. If we consider only the evils
we have avoided during his late Majesty’s reign, we shall
find abundant matter of gratitude towards him and respect
for his memory. His character would not afford subject
for Epic poetry, but will look well in the sober page of
history. Conscious, perhaps, of this, he was too little
regardful of sciences and the fine arts; he considered
common sense as his best panegyrist. The monarch
whose qualities are brilliant enough to entitle him to
glory, cultivates the love of the Muses, and their handmaid
arts, painting, sculpture, etc., sensible that they will
blazon and adorn his fame. I hope our young Monarch
will copy his predecessor’s solid virtues, and if he endeavours
to make them more brilliant by the help of
poetry, eloquence, etc., etc., the happiness and glory of
Britain will be great. His present Majesty’s religious<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_211">[211]</span>
disposition, and decent moral conduct, give us hope we
shall not be plunged into riot, and lost in debauchery

would soon affect a rich and luxurious nation, and the
profaneness and immorality of Charles the Second’s days
would, from the more prosperous state of our nation at
present, be outdone....</p>

<p>“I will now thank your Lordship for your letter and
the Highland compositions. Your remarks go far in
staggering my faith as to their authenticity. I think
they convince me the poems cannot be as ancient as
pretended. It seems to me possible, that some great
bard might from uncertain and broken tradition, and
from the scattered songs of former bards, form an epic
poem, which might not agree with history. The pillars
in the hall of Fingal struck me at first reading; but I
imagined they might not refer to polished marble pillars,
but to smooth lime or beech trees which one may suppose
to have been used as supporters in very rude
buildings, and which would look smooth and shapely to
one not used to polished marble; and I imagine convenience
taught the use of such supporters long before
they were introduced as ornaments.... I hear Lord
Marchmont says our old Highland bard is a modern
gentleman of his acquaintance; if it is so, we have a
living Poet who may dispute the <i>pas</i> on Parnassus with
Pindar and the greatest of the ancients, and I honour
him for carrying the Muses into the country and letting
them step majestic over hills, mountains and rivers
instead of tamely walking in the Park or Piccadilly....
The Bishop of Ossory tells me Mr. Macpherson receives
an £100 per annum subscription while he stays in the
Highlands to translate the poems; if he is writing them,
he should have a thousand at least....</p>

<p>“Dr. Gregory, in talking of Mr. Hume, said he had a
great respect for your Lordship. The Dialogue of Bayle
and Locke could not be agreeable to him.... Dr.
Gregory says Mr. Hume told him he spent an evening
with me at Mr. Ramsay’s, and he had received very<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_212">[212]</span>
favourable impressions of me, and, I find, said much
more of me than I deserve. The Doctor told him I was
not of his freethinking system, but Mr. Hume thinks
that no fault in a woman.... Dr. Monsey is revenging
my coquetry with Lord Bath by an assiduous courtship
of Miss Talbot, but he can no more be untrue to me
than the needle to the pole!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“GAZETTE EXTRA&shy;ORDINARY”</div>

<p>The same day, October 31, Lord Lyttelton writes
from his house in Hill Street—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Madonna</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“According to my promise, I now write to tell
you the news of the town; and it is with great pleasure
that I can assure you all parties unite in the strongest
expressions of zeal and affection for our young King,
and approbation of his behaviour. Since his accession
he has shown the most obliging kindness to all the
royal family, and done everything that was necessary to
give his government quiet and unanimity in this difficult
crisis.... There will be no changes in the ministry,
and I believe few at Court. The Duke of Newcastle
hesitated some time whether he should undertake his
arduous office in a new reign, but has yielded at last to
the earnest Desires of the King himself, of the Duke of
Cumberland, and of the heads of all Parties and Factions,
even those who were formerly most hostile to
him. His friend and mine, Lord Hardwicke, has been
most graciously talked to by the King in two or three
audiences, and will, I doubt not, continue in the Cabinet
Council with the weight and influence he ought to have
there.... Lord George Sackville has been admitted to
kiss the king’s hand, and thus ends my <em>gazette extraordinary</em>.
As for myself, I got well to town on Wednesday
night, was at Court on Thursday morning, was
spoken graciously to by the King, and am told by everybody
that I grow fat.” He then urges Mrs. Montagu to
return from Northumberland at once. “I have often
told you that you are a mere hot-house plant, fine and<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_213">[213]</span>

been staying in Mrs. Montagu’s house till her own was
furnished. Further on in the same letter he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The King has opened his grandfather’s Will in
presence of all the royal family, and it is said the Duke
of Cumberland is heir to the much greater part of what
his Majesty had to dispose of, but that is much less than
was supposed. The next best share is the Princess
Emilia’s.<a id="2_FNanchor_295" href="#2_Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The sums are not mentioned. Mr. Pitt has
just had a new and very extraordinary mark of the
affection of the city, in an inscription they have put
upon the first stone of the new bridge. I would have
sent it you with to-day’s paper in which it is printed,
but somebody has stolen it out of my room. You will
see it in the next Chronicle. It speaks of a certain <em>contagion</em>
by which Generals, Admirals, Armies and Fleets
catch valour and prudence from him, to the great benefit
of our affairs.”</p>

<p>From Hill Street, on November 5, Lord Lyttelton
again writes to Mrs. Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If I were to write the History of my own Times,
I would transcribe into it your character of the late
King, and should thereby pay my Debt of gratitude to
his memory. I would only add to it that it appears
from several Wills he has left, that he never had been
such a Hoarder of Treasure as was generally supposed.<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_214">[214]</span>
And of what he had saved this war has consumed so
much that he was able to leave no more to his three
children than thirty thousand pounds in equal proportions,
and I have heard that the Duke has given up his
to his sisters. Princess Emily is come to live in my
brother’s House like a private woman. It is said the
Princess of Wales will not come to St. James’s. The
great court offices are not yet settled, but I believe it is
certain that Lord Bute<a id="2_FNanchor_296" href="#2_Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> will be continued Groom of the
Stole, and Lord Huntingdon<a id="2_FNanchor_297" href="#2_Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Master of the Horse.”</p>

hung very high, all the people who passed Newark
to-day got a great deal of water into their carriage,

this morning, and it is now raining hard, so I had good

<p>In a letter to Mr. Montagu, from Stilton, is this
amusing passage—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lord Panmure pass’d me on the road yesterday, and
I hear all the Scotch are gone to town from Peers to
Pedlars, and I suppose all with the same intention to
sell something and to get money. I found that a Scotch
countess had bought all the black cloth, crapes and
bombazeen, black ribbons, and fans at Darlington before
the poor shopkeepers knew of the King’s death. She
bought a great many suits of broad cloth and crape,
which must be with an intention to sell them at a higher
price in town, but surely nothing could be more mean
than to enter into such a traffick and take advantage
of the Shopkeepers’ ignorance, and it seems to me not
honest. This lady is wife to Lord C——t; I believe I mistook
when I called her a countess. The town was soon
inform’d of the reason she had bought such a quantity
of mourning, and I wonder she was not mobbed. The
ladies at Darlington and in the neighbourhood are very
angry, for she left but two yards of crape in the whole
town.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING’S FIRST SPEECH — GOING TO COURT</div>

<p>Writing on November 20 to her husband, Mrs.
Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The young King spoke his speech<a id="2_FNanchor_300" href="#2_Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> with great grace;
his voice, they say, is very fine, and his delivery most
remarkably good. The Princess Dowager is not to be
at St. James’s, and people think she looks chagrin’d; no
doubt she had visions of power and authority which will
probably not be answered; all people seem glad that she
is not likely to have influence. Dr. Wilson made a very
flattering sermon at Court, upon which the King express’d
great displeasure, and order’d all the Chaplains should
be told he did not come to Church to hear himself praised.
Lord Egremont<a id="2_FNanchor_301" href="#2_Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> made a fine speech in the House of
Lords for the address. Lord Royston is to move for
the address in the House of Commons to-day, and Sir
Richard Grosvenor,<a id="2_FNanchor_302" href="#2_Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> who is to be made a peer, it is
said, seconds him. Mr. Pratt<a id="2_FNanchor_303" href="#2_Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> is to be made Lord Chief
Justice in room of Willes, whose son is to be Solicitor-General,
and Mr. York attorney. Some say Pratt is to
be made a Peer. There seems a very strong union
between Pitt and the Duke of Newcastle, but as yet
no one knows how things will combine. The whole
Cocoa Tree<a id="2_FNanchor_304" href="#2_Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and every human creature has been at
Court, and this being said one day in a large company,

to town, but when you did you intended I should be
presented. Mrs. Boscawen said she suppos’d I should
be introduced by Lady Bute, as we were relations,
and visited; I answered no, for I should not go as a
courtier....</p>

<p>“I should ask Lady Cardigan to carry me, who was
the head of the Montagu family, and a person who went
as a great independant lady to pay her duty to her<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_218">[218]</span>
sovereign without being a courtier. It seems if I am
to go to Court, I must not appear anywhere till I have
kiss’d hands, which makes it necessary, if done, to be
done soon, but I shall wait your orders, and I beg you
to speak freely.”</p>

<p>“The distance j am now at from you, unhappily
hinders me from discussing an affair of this moment
with you and consulting with myne or your friends.
At present j can only say that if you mean nothing
more than paying your duty to our new sovereign j
see no harm in it, and j think Lady Cardigan of all
others the properest person to introduce you; but if
you go further, before you give your attendance at a
Court, j wish you would take the consequences into
your most serious thoughts. The principal reason of
my absenting myself ever since j was Member of Parliament
was that j did not concur in the measures that
were then taking, and the Principal members in the
opposition thought they had no business at St. James,
and j believe neither the wifes of the Peers nor of the
Members of the House of Commons were found there.
If j should be still so unhappy as out of dislike for
the present measures not to alter my way of acting,
and not to appear at Court, would it be proper for you
to be attendant? Indeed, it seems to me that it would
not, but if you can make out the contrary upon any
sound Principles of reason j will readily submit. I
have for many years liv’d in a state of Independancy
though j may truly call it of Proscription, so far as
those could make it to those who thought not, and acted
not with them where politics they thought endanger’d
the Liberties and good of their country, am j to alter
now, or maintain the same conduct j hitherto have
done? Whilst j flatter’d myself that we were in the
same way of thinking, and that my conduct met with
your approbation, j did hardly suffer anything. I then<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_219">[219]</span>
thought and still reflect with the utmost sense of gratitude
on the sacrifice you made me in your early bloom,
by giving up all the pleasures and gaieties of a Court,
and it was the greater because you had all the advantages
of beauty and sense to shine and make a figure
there. I think that capacity is not so far gone as you
in your modesty are pleas’d to say, and j may add in
some sense perhaps improv’d, either at a Court or anywhere
else j wish you every thing that is good that you
may long enjoy that good will and esteem which your
merit has acquir’d you, and leave the rest to your own
candid and impartial consideration.”</p>

Guards to take them into custody. The story is too
long for a letter. Mr. Townshend appears to have been
too hasty: Lord Albemarle behaved very well, and all
is now made up. Mr. Beckford in the House of Commons
the day before yesterday call’d our German campaign
this year a <em>languid campaign</em>, for which Mr. Pitt
gave him a notable threshing, repeating languid and
languor several times, and once how rash must that
gentleman be, how inconsiderate, if he calls this languid,
after repeating what had been done, and after enlarging
on everything, again, again, and again, retorting the
<em>languid</em> upon Beckford, who himself made a languid
campaign, not returning to the charge. I heard of a
good piece of witt of Mr. Pitt on my Lord Mayor of
London’s absurdly asking him in the Drawing-room,
where the secret expedition was destined. He ask’d
his Lordship if he could keep a secret, which the grave
Magistrate assured him he could upon his honour, and
expected to be inform’d, on which Mr. Pitt only made a
low bow and said, <em>so can I, Sir</em>, a very proper reproof
for his impertinent question.”</p>

without infirmitys indeed) that is at this Instant over

write with as much Spirit and Love to his Mistress,
as the Bishop does with Loyalty to his Master, with
this difference only, the one wishes this contention of
Love may never be decided, the other hopes it may
be brought to an issue as soon as possible, by the only
proper means of Determination, and let the Posterity
arising from thence be a proof to future Generations
of the ardency of the Affection of her</p>

me from blame in case of accident. As I do not expect
a billet-doux every morning, I was unluckily asleep
(observe that I do not say not dreaming of Lord Bath)
when your letter arrived. I cannot express how much
I admire your Lordship’s parody of a Bishop’s pastoral<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_223">[223]</span>

immediately comply with your proposal; but if you
will be content with a sentimental love till I arrive at
the tender age of eighty, a person and a passion so
ripened by time must be very yielding. And according
to the latest reckoning of the learned and ingenious
Mr. Whiston, the Millenium will then commence, so
that we may have a proper period in which to prove
our constancy and love; and at a moderate computation,
may produce a thousand of those proofs of it

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I dined with Lord Bath on Sunday; he was in high
spirits. At his table I heard an admirable <i>bon mot</i> of
Lord Chesterfield’s; he said the King was in doubt
whether he should burn Scotch coal, Pitt coal, or
Newcastle coal!... Our young King had a fall from
his horse this morning, but no mischief, except a little
bruise on his shoulder. His attendants seemed much
frightened, at which he smiled and told them they
forgot he had four brothers.”</p>

40 years for her is more than I can promise; besides,
Madam, I would have you consider that in all the conquests
Love makes, there is on the male side, constantly
a little pride and vanity; do you think that I have not
something of that kind, in the pleasure I propose to
myself of making Mr. Montagu jealous, and of triumphing
and insulting over Dr. Monsey; and can you yourself
promise me either of these forty years hence? In
conscience therefore reduce the horrid period of forty
years to twenty at most, and tell me in your next, come
twenty years hence and be happy. But all you promise
in your letter is, that the beginning of next century,
perhaps, you may begin to listen. This cold proceeding,

you do so audacious a thing, whilst your Hubby is alive
too? Had he broke his neck down a coal pit the matter
had been nothing, but to inflame the heart of a young
monarch when he can reap no benefit from it without
breaking the laws of his Kingdom, or your breaking the
Laws of God. Let me tell you, Madam (if I now may
presume to tell you anything), it is a very imprudent
step. Emin has miscarried in Persia, and so now you
will let yourself down to the deluding hopes of being
Queen of England. Can you sleep this night while
Majesty lies tumbling and tossing, and starts at Montagu
peeping thro’ his curtains;—My Kingdom for this

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew Robinson</span>, Mrs. Montagu’s eldest brother,
who had been member for the borough of Canterbury,
did not propose to offer himself for re-election to the
new parliament, but presented the Canterbury address
to the new king at Court. He was clad in such a
peculiar and uncourtierlike garb that his sister writes
to her husband at Newcastle—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am glad he is gone into the country, but he has
made a most astonishing appearance at court with the
Canterbury address. Morris says he hears of nothing
else. I wish the Beefeaters had not let him pass the
door. Lord Harry Beauclerc on the buzz his appearance
occasioned, desired the people to be quiet, for
that he had never seen the gentleman so well dressed
before.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">ADMIRAL BOSCAWEN ILL</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu, having attended the Durham election
in favour of Sir Thomas Clavering, was preparing to go
to Huntingdon for his own re-election. In Mrs. Montagu’s
next letter she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I told you in my last that Admiral Boscawen was
ill of a fever, I hope he is out of danger. The noble<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_229">[229]</span>
admiral does not fight so well with a fever as he does
with the French; he will not lye in bed, where he would
soonest subdue it. Poor Mrs. Boscawen is very anxious
and unhappy about the Admiral, and indeed the loss to
her and her children would be as great as possible.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this letter she remarks upon having heard from
Mrs. William Robinson, her sister-in-law, from Lisbon
dated November 12: “they are all well, and going on to
Madrid.” “They” were the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Robinson,
his wife, and her brother, Mr. Richardson, who, being
in bad health, was ordered abroad, and was going to
Italy. On December 20, Admiral Boscawen is reported
as out of danger, but on the 27th Mrs. Montagu writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His fever still hangs upon him, his strength is
quite subdued; any sudden attack, any degree more of
fever, and my dear Friend loses a good husband, her
children a fond father, their situation in life will suffer
a grievous alteration, and the publick will be deprived
of a man who serves it with zeal and ability and is
always more tender of the honour of his country than
of his own person.”</p>
</div>

<p>The admiral had a relapse, and Mrs. Montagu, with
her husband’s permission, flew to see her friend, but,
to avoid alarming the admiral, slept at Mr. Botham’s at
Albury. She, however, returned to London, as the
admiral could not bear his wife out of his sight, and
begrudged any friend taking her away from him for an
instant. In this same letter she mentions that old Mr.
Wortley Montagu was very ill.</p>

<p>Dr. Monsey, who himself was very unwell, wrote on
January 9 to tell Mrs. Montagu he was sure the admiral
would not recover; he begs her to remember it is God’s
will, and “to try and guard Mrs. Boscawen’s mind and<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_230">[230]</span>
let money and the world be thrown into the Coal
Hole.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF ADMIRAL BOSCAWEN</div>

<p>The admiral expired on January 10 at 7 a.m. He
died of a putrid fever, and before death sent for his
sister, Mrs. Frederick, to desire her to take his wife and
children to London the moment he was dead. Mrs.
Montagu went at once to her friend to endeavour to
comfort her. Mr. Montagu, with his characteristic
kindness, begged Mrs. Boscawen to go to Hill Street,
but she remained at the Admiralty. Mrs. Montagu
writes of her on January 17—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I thank God her mind is very calm and settled, she
endeavours all she can to bring herself to submit to this
dire misfortune; I know time must be her best comforter,
so that I oppose her lamentations rarely and
gently, but when they continue long, set before her the
merit of her five children, the want they will have of
her, and the comfort she may derive from them....
Mr. Boscawen has left all his fortune, except a purchase
he made in Cornwall, to Mrs. Boscawen at her entire
disposition, the land in Cornwall he has left her only
for life, and then to his eldest son. This estate cost but
£10,000, and so is a small part of his fortune, so that the
children are entirely dependent on her. I hear old Mr.
Wortley can last but a very short time. It is supposed
Lady Mary will come to England.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF OLD MR. WORTLEY MONTAGU</div>

<p>Writing to her husband, still at Newcastle, at the
end of January, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I believe it will be agreeable to you to hear that
Lord Sandwich called on me this morning to desire me

one to canvass, another to be elected.... Mr. Wortley<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_231">[231]</span>
Montagu dyed last night, the disposition of his effects
not known as yet, by next post you shall hear.”</p>
</div>

<p>In her next letter she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have had a full account of Mr. Wortley’s will, it
runs thus:—‘To his son £1000 per annum rentcharge,’
with an order it should not be liable to his debts, which
by-the-bye is nonsense. The Leicestershire estate, we
know to our sorrow is his. If the present wife<a id="2_FNanchor_313" href="#2_Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> dyes
and he has legitimate issue, that issue is to have the
Wortley estate. In case he has not such issue, then
the whole of his personal and real estate is to go to
Lady Bute’s second son, he taking the noble name of
Wortley. Two thousand pounds apiece indeed to each
of Lady Bute’s younger children! The old gentleman’s
wealth is reckoned immense.”</p>

<p>In another letter his estate is stated to be £800,000
in money, and £17,000 per annum in land, mines, etc.!</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu writes in reply to this—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am extremely sorry that Mr. Wortley has made
such a will as you mention. I think he has been
unworthy of being a Father. I cannot pretend to say
but his son gave him too good reason to take care he
should not waste and consume his estate, it was mine
and the opinion of others that, as the phrase is, he would
have tyed him up, but if he had done it in the literal
sense he would have been less cruel to him; this poor
man was not without very good parts, he was greatly
altered; if he had done kindly by him, it was not impossible
that he might have been reclaimed and have
yet made some figure in life. What is now to become
of him I don’t know. I suppose he is not to come into
Parliament again, and if so I cannot see what he can do
but leave his native country, and live in perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_232">[232]</span>
banishment abroad. I cannot but greatly commiserate
this poor man, and reflect with horror on his cruel
unrelenting parent.”</p>

<p>On February 15 Mr. Montagu writes from Hinchingbrooke,

character your Lordship gave of it kept up my hopes
and my spirits through the long tedious speeches with
which it opens, and upon the whole it appears to me to
be one of the best of Voltaire’s Tragedies, as it is, what
few of his are, interesting. Pompous declamation
season’d with Moral reflections is surely far from the
perfection of dramatick writing, tho’ in a nation too
much polish’d and refin’d, it is prefer’d to the natural
sallies of passion in our Shakespear, as fops love
essences better than the flowers from whence they are
extracted. I find in this Tragedy many petty larcenies
from Corneille. The character of Aménaide is in
part an imitation of the Sister of Horatius, but the
Roman name supports the <i>fierté</i> of her character, born
in any other city I should call her a termagant, there I
consider her as a She Roman, the female of the Lion.<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_234">[234]</span>

as by law establish’d, but despises forms and follows
sentiment, a dangerous guide. Design’d by Nature to
act but a second part, it is a woman’s duty to obey
rules, she is not to make or redress them. I must
confess that Aménaide is noble and heroick, and a
proper mistress for a Knight Errant, whose motto is
‘l’amour et l’honneur.’ I have seen many poems
form’d on the manners of Chivalry, but I never saw
them before in Drama. They admit of the bombast in
honour and love, which the French and Spanish Theater
affect, and will furnish those brilliant sentiments they
so much admire, but which indeed come better from
any Muse but the pathetick Melpomène.</p>

louder than Mrs. Prichard.<a id="2_FNanchor_318" href="#2_Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> I have taken the liberty to

canto,<a id="2_FNanchor_319" href="#2_Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> which far exceeded my expectation. The various
incidents recited take off that sameness of character
which appeared in the detached pieces, and which were
their greatest fault. The original Ersh is to be seen
at Mr. Millar’s. I have also enclosed a letter from
Edinburgh which gives an account of these poems. By
this long letter I have taken some revenge upon your
Lordship for not coming here last night, and now I am
in perfect charity, mix’d with some compassion for the
trouble I have given you.</p>

a paper upon it: <i>Enough for a Mantua and petty coat.</i>
Now, Madam, as I neither wear a mantua nor pettycoats,
I do not know what to do with it, unless you will accept

send privately to her without letting her know or guess
from whom they come, may be of more real use and
service to her, you may do it as you think fit, and I can
venture to say of the Bank Bills just what I have done
of the Greek books, that they are of little use to me, and
possibly may be of great service to her, and more in

<div class="sidenote">ANOTHER DIALOGUE OF THE DEAD — BERENICE <i><abbr title="VERSUS">V.</abbr></i> CLEOPATRA —
THE “WORLD WELL LOST!”</div>

<p>This is the dialogue which I believe has not yet been
published:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Berenice and Cleopatra.</span>”</p>

<p><i>Berenice.</i> The similitudes and dissimilitudes of our
fortune have long made me wish to converse with you,
if the charming, the victorious Cleopatra by her lover
prefer’d to glory, to empire, to life, will deign to hold
converse with the forsaken, the abandon’d, the discarded
Berenice.</p>

<p><i>Cleopatra.</i> The scorns of Octavius, the bite of the
aspic, the waters of Lethe have so subdued my female
vanity, that I will own to you I greatly suspect my
greater success with my lover did not arise so much
from my charms as in my skill of management of them.</p>

<p><i>Berenice.</i> I can scarce understand you. Beauty and
love I thought to be the greatest attractions. In the
first you must have excell’d me, but in the second you
certainly could not: I had beauty, youth, regal dignity,
and an elevated mind. I was distinguished by many
qualities and accomplishments which were so dedicated
to my Lover, that of all I had been and all I could be,
I was, I would be, only <i>l’amante</i> of Titus. I thought the
next person in merit and dignity to Titus himself was
the woman who ador’d him, and I was more proud of
the homage I paid him, than of all I had receiv’d from
lovers or subjects. But you, Cleopatra, had loved Cesar
before Anthony, and other passions besides the gentle
one of love seemed still to have your heart. Yet for you
Anthony despised the dangers of war, the competition
of a rival in Empire, the motives of military glory, and
the resentment of a Senate and people not yet taught to
submit to or flatter the passions of a master. Over
these you triumph’d; but I was sacrificed to the low
murmurs of the people, and the cautious counsels of
gray-headed Statesmen. Was it that Minerva desired
to triumph over Venus in the noblest and gentlest heart
that ever was contain’d in the breast of mortal? Tell
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_239">[239]</span>me, Cleopatra, for 1700 years have not made me forget
my love and my grief?</p>

<p><i>Cleopatra.</i> I have often with attention listen’d to your
story; and your looks, on which still remain the sadness
of a lover’s farewell, move my compassion. I wish I
could have assisted you with my counsels when Titus
was meditating your departure. I would have taught
you those arts by which I enslaved the Soul of Anthony,
and brought Ambition and the Roman Eagles to lye at
my feet.</p>

<p><i>Berenice.</i> Your arts would have been of little service to
me, I had no occasion to counterfeit love. From Titus’s
perfection one learn’d to love in reality beyond whatever
fiction pretended; no feigned complaisance could imitate
my sympathy; if he sigh’d I wept, if he was grave I
grew melancholy, if he sicken’d I dyed. My heart
echoed his praises, it beat for his glory, it rejoiced in
his fortunes, it trembled at his dangers.</p>

<p><i>Cleopatra.</i> Indeed, Berenice, you talk more like a
Shepherdess than a great Queen. You might perhaps
in the simplicity of pastoral life have engaged some
humble Swain, but there was too much of nature and
too little of art in your conduct, to captivate a man used
to flattery, to pleasures, to variety. I find you was but
the mirror of Titus, you gave him back his own image,
while I presented every hour a new Cleopatra to Anthony.
I was gay, voluptuous, haughty, gracious, fond
and indifferent by turns; if he frown’d on me, I smiled
on Dollabella; if he grew thoughtful, I turn’d the Banquet
to a Riot. I dash’d the soberness of counsels by
the vivacity of mirth, and gilded over his disgrace by
show and magnificence; if his reason began to return,
I subdued it by fondness, or disturb’d it by jealousy.
Thus did I preserve my conquest, establish my fame,
and put Anthony first in the list of</p>

<p>
“all the mighty names by love undone.”<br>
</p>

<p>Had I only wept when honour and Octavia call’d him
home I might have been the burthen of a love ballad, or<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_240">[240]</span>
subject of a tender Elegy, who now am the glory of our
sex, and the great instance of beauty’s power. Do not
you wish you had used the same managements?</p>

<p><i>Berenice.</i> I might have used them had I loved the
same man: Cleopatra, the coquette was a proper mistress
for the Reveller Anthony; but the god-like Titus,
the delight as well as Master of Mankind, left no part of
the heart unengaged and at liberty to dissemble. What
had not yielded to his wisdom, submitted to his witt,
was subdued by his magnanimity, or won by his gentleness;
when affection does not vary, behaviour cannot
change; and methinks Anthony should have quitted you
from distrust of your love, and Titus have retain’d me
from confidence in mine. After what you have told me,
I am more than ever surprised at your fate and my
own.</p>

<p><i>Cleopatra.</i> If you want this explain’d ask Eneas,
Theseus, Jason, and the infinite multitude of faithless
lovers, but if my authority will pass, believe me Anthony
was preserved by his doubt of my love, and Titus
was lost by his confidence in yours. Do not look so
concern’d. From the era of your disaster to this very
day you will find every faithful and fond Berenice discarded,
while the gay, vain, and capricious fair one is to
her Anthony a Cleopatra and the “world well lost.”</p>

<p>Emin, from “Standgate Creek, on board of the ship

addressing her thus—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the wisdom of Europe, sister to the great King
of Prussia, excellent Mrs. Montagu.”</p>
</div>

<p>Not only did he think Mrs. Montagu equal in cleverness
to Frederick the Great, but he considered her forehead
and eyes like his, to the great indignation of Lord
Bath and Dr. Monsey, who pronounced it impossible
she should resemble so bloodthirsty a character.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter took leave of Mrs. Montagu on May 18,
and that very evening Mrs. Montagu writes to her—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You left London only this morning, and I am
writing to you to-night; does it not seem unreasonable?
I hope not, as you must know there are habits which
it is hard to break, and alas! I was in the habit of conversing
with you every day. I feel like a traveller, who
by the chearfull light of the Sun has pleasantly pursued
his day’s journey, but seeing it below the horizon, enjoys
and would fain prolong the twilight, which tho’ it has
not the warmth and lustre of the noon-day, yet is a
kind interposition between it and the gloom of the
night.”</p>

<p>She dates her letter from Ealing, where she had
gone to the Botham’s for the night, “imagining I should
hear your tones better from the nightingale than in the<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_242">[242]</span>
din and chatter of London.” So much did Mrs. Carter
value Mrs. Montagu’s letters that she always noted the
day and year of their reception of them, which is a
great help to an editor in compiling, as many of Mrs.
Montagu’s letters are undated. In the end of this letter
she mentions that she is returning to London next day
to spend the evening with Mrs. Boscawen, who was to
leave the Admiralty that day for her new house.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She will be too apt to reflect on the change of her

intrepidly look on their condition! Mr. Melmoth<a id="2_FNanchor_322" href="#2_Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> made

a flight into Berkshire; and here I have been ever since
Friday evening, leading a Pastoral life in the finest
weather I ever saw. Tho’ the most sage Horace says
we change our climate without changing our disposition,
I must be of another opinion, for by only the
difference of latitude and longitude between Hill Street
and Sandleford I am become one of the most reasonable,
quiet, good, kind of country gentlewoman that ever
was. In the days when misses employ’d their crimping
and wimpling irons upon cheese-cakes and tarts, not on
flounces and furbelows, and matrons used no rouge, but
a little cochineal to give a fine colour to a dried neat’s-foot
tongue, they could not be further from the temper

proud display of his treasures, as at the pomp of a rich
man, when it goes beyond the bounds modesty and a
sound judgment should set to it. I agree with you that
his love verses are insufferable. I think you and I who
have never been in love, could describe it better were
we ask’d, <i>what is it like?</i> I think some of his verses, like
Anacreon, very pretty, and the verses by the god of love
in honour of Anacreon are very pretty tho’ a little too

in spite of you both, some silly prejudices against the
Author and the language the poem was originally
written in, a little damped my expectations, and the
beginning, in which he imitates Milton, with all the
faintness of reflected beams, make me advance very
soberly. But what a feast is the Patriarchal dinner!
How sweetly innocent their manners! Eve’s horror
at the first storm, her surprize at Adam’s fastening up
the mouth of the cave, concern at the first sight of death,
which is finely supposed to seize a dove, because in that
animal only could the grief of a surviving friend be
shown, with ten thousand other circumstances in hers
and Adam’s narration, all so natural and yet so new
that I must call Mr. Gesner a Poet. A Poet should
create, but he should not make monsters. I think our
Author has not the sublime, but his genius suits his
subject. What a noble piety! what a purity of heart
in Abel! and how finely is his character contrasted
with Cain’s. Abel’s are virtues of disposition and
temper in a great degree, and so are Cain’s vices, which
rightly imagined in a state of life where example and
discipline could not have so much influence as in a
larger society and more mix’d life. Milton’s and Mr.
Gesner’s pastoral scenes are so ennobled and refined by
Religion, that the Shepherds and Shepherdesses who<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_246">[246]</span>
worship the wanton Pan and drunken Silenus, make a
mean figure when compared to them. I agree with you
in liking Mr. Gesner’s Pastorals extreamly, but let him
still keep to the more than golden age of the Poets. I
would fain propose to him to take the story of Joseph
next. He has a fine genius for Drama! The last three
books of Abel make a noble tragedy. Did you not drop
a tear at the lamentation of Cain’s children over Abel’s
body? <i lang="fr">Il ne se reveillera plus! Il ne se reveillera plus!</i>
How simple! how natural! how affecting! What a
witchcraft is there in words! repeat, <i>il est mort</i>, it is
nothing, but the simplicity of children who had not a
name for death and the words at once signifying the
circumstance is very touching.... I have taken a
house at Tunbridge from the 3rd of July. I hope my
dear friend will be ready to come to me. I shall send
the post-chaize to you as soon as I am at Tunbridge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOING TO TUNBRIDGE — CHARACTER OF LORD BATH</div>

<p>Writing from Sandleford on June 26 to Mrs. Scott,
Mrs. Montagu mentions that she is going to Tunbridge</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“for 6 or 7 weeks perhaps, and the rest of the summer
I shall pass at Sandleford, except my excursion to Bath
Easton. Mrs. Carter is to come to Tunbridge to me as
soon as I get thither, and, I hope, stay with me the
whole season. I was so fortunate as to enjoy her company
much longer in town this year than usual, but that
only makes me wish the more to have her again. She
was not in the house with me in town, preferring the
quiet of a lodging to herself, and indeed it would not be
any delight to Mr. Montagu to have her in the house;
tho’ he says she would be a good sort of woman <em>if she
was not so pious</em>.<a id="2_FNanchor_327" href="#2_Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> My Lord Bath told me he was to<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_247">[247]</span>
go to Bath on Wednesday, the day we dined with
him....</p>

<p>“I shall have Mrs. Boscawen for my neighbour at
Tunbridge; she is to be at Sir Sydney Smythe’s, only
three miles from the Wells. Lady Frances Williams
is in the deepest affliction for Lady Coningsbye.<a id="2_FNanchor_328" href="#2_Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> To
show the last respect to her, Lady Frances staid in the
house with the dead body in spite of all her friends
could do; she did not leave Lady Coningsbye’s house
till last Saturday; she has been so singularly unfortunate
that, had she not the strongest piety and the
strongest reason to support her, she must sink under
the repeated strokes of affliction.... I suppose you
have read Dr. Hawkesworth’s<a id="2_FNanchor_329" href="#2_Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> ‘Oriental Tales,’ it is
not written with so much spirit as the Oriental tales
in ‘the Adventurer’ which were by him, but there are
some fine things in it.... I have heard my Lord Bath
speak with great regard for you and Lady Bab Montagu.
I believe we shall call on him on Monday, on our
way to London. We were asked to dine or lye there in
our journey down, and at our return. He has recovered
his health and spirits and is the most delightfull companion
imaginable. I think he has great good qualities,
and I do not perceive the least of that covetousness
which was attributed to him while his wife lived; he
lives nobly, entertains generously, and I know many
acts of generosity he has done, and I have known them
from the report and acknowledgements of the persons
obliged, for by his behaviour to such of them as I have
seen at his house you would think he had received
favours from them, which nobly enhances the benefit.
He seems to have the strongest sense of Religion, and
on all occasions to show it without the ostentation of
one who wants to be praised for piety, nor does he ever
in the gayest of his conversation forget the respect due
to every moral duty. It would give one pain to discover
any faults in one who has such extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_248">[248]</span>
perfections and endowments, and I think his Lordship
has outlived the errors which the hustling of a mighty
Spirit may in youth have led him: as to his consort,
she was, in Milton’s phrase, <em>a cleaving mischief in his
way to virtue</em>.</p>

<p>“I am glad Lord Bath is to be at Tunbridge. Mrs.
Carter is a great favourite, and I hope we shall have a
good deal of his company.”</p>

<p>She winds up her letter with high commendation of

<p>Dr. Young’s allusion to Kew was the fact that he
had recently been appointed Clerk of the Closet to the
Princess Dowager of Wales.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FUTURE QUEEN</div>

<p>On July 7 Mrs. Montagu started for Tunbridge
Wells, and on the following Monday sent her post-chaise
to fetch Mrs. Carter, and Lord Bath arrived from
London on the same day. Mr. Montagu, who was going
to Sandleford for a while, mentions in a letter of July 11
to his wife that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“there was a great appearance of the privy council
when the King declar’d his intention of demanding the
Princess of Mecklenburgh in marriage, a request that
can never be denied. The family is ancient, and the
blood high, but I suppose the Dukedom not very rich,
but this may be helped with subsidies, etc., but this is
not much to be grudged if by making our young Monarch
happy it contributes to that of the Nation, tho’
Princes are under a disadvantage from which their subjects
are free, of marrying those whom they have never
seen or convers’d with, still I hope there is reason to be
believed that this alliance, as it was of the young Monarch’s
choosing and not of the imposing of a Father,
and as money, etc., is out of the case, that care has been
taken by those employ’d to give a true information both
of the perfections of the mind and body of this Princess,
and he will be happy.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu adds that the pictures at Newbold
Verdon were to be sold for Mr. Edward Wortley-Montagu’s debts,
but that a list of them had been sent
to him by Mr. E. Wortley-Montagu, who desired to
know which he would accept of as a present. Mr.
Montagu had marked his brother’s portrait (Mr. James
Montagu), and asks his wife to say if there were
any she wished for. Very probably the picture by
Sir Peter Lely of the first Earl of Sandwich, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_250">[250]</span>
Montagu’s grandfather, which I possess, came from
there.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lord Bath conveyed Mrs. Montagu and Mrs. Carter
“to Mr. Pratt’s<a id="2_FNanchor_331" href="#2_Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> place, call’d Bayham Abbey, which I
believe you once saw with Mr. Pitt. The ruins of the
Abbey are very noble. Tho’ the Gothick buildings have
not in their time of utmost perfection the beauty of the
Græcian; time seems to have a greater triumph in the
destruction of strength than of grace.... I have just
now the pleasure of hearing Pondicherry<a id="2_FNanchor_332" href="#2_Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> is taken. I

<p>On July 20 Dr. Stillingfleet writes from Stanlake,
Berks, the seat of his friend, Richard Neville Aldworth,
expressing his regret that he cannot accept
Mrs. Montagu’s kind invitation to Tunbridge Wells,
as his friend, Mr. Aldworth, had made him promise
to spend a summer with him at Stanlake. “This
friend has had his constitution broken so by the
gout, that he is become a valetudinarian, and therefore
I can the less think of leaving him. He is
ordered by his Physician to drink the Sunning Hill
Waters, and we are going there as soon as he is

<p>On July 30 Dr. Young writes that he is obliged
to refuse Mrs. Montagu’s kind invitation “as he
had a friend with him he could not leave,” and as
“her Royal Highness sent me word she would send
for me when she wanted me; for these reasons I
deny myself the great pleasure of waiting on you.
I have ordered some Stanzas to be sent to you;
they are of a cooling nature, and may qualify your

<p>On the 8th of July George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> had announced his
intention of demanding in marriage the Princess Charlotte
of Mecklenburg Strelitz; negotiations were immediately
commenced. Mrs. Montagu writes from
Tunbridge Wells to her husband thus—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are all disappointed here at hearing our new
Queen is fair; the first report was that by a lively<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_252">[252]</span>
bloom she would cast a shade over the white complexions
of our royal family. The sight of our brilliant
Court, the salutations of our navy on her arrival, the
opulent appearance of our towns, and the greatness of
our capital city will astonish her. I hope her mind is
more proportioned to her lot in marriage than such a
situation is to her present circumstances. A noble
mind will fill a great situation, and enjoy it with pleasure
and gratitude, without the swellings of insolence, but
such a change is dangerous where there is a mediocrity
of sense and virtue. I heartily wish she may be worthy
of our young King, be pleasing in the domestick scene,
and great in the publick; his good nature will impart to
her a share of power and a degree of confidence, and I
wish for the publick she may never abuse the one, nor
misapply the other. There seems not to be a very good
choice of ladies about her, there is not one who is quite
fit to teach her even the forms of her publick conduct,
none at all equal to advise her private, ignorant as she
must be of the behaviour that will be expected of her,
she should have had some woman of quality of remarkable
discretion, character, and politeness, whom high
birth and great situation had approached as nearly as a
subject can to the station of a Queen. Lady Bute would
have been the properest person, but I suppose she
might out of delicacy avoid putting herself about the
Queen’s person, as thinking it might look like watching
her, and indeed so happy as Lady Bute is in her circumstances,
the slavery of personal attendance is more than
anything but great ambition could pay her for. I
think, however, they have chosen the ladies<a id="2_FNanchor_333" href="#2_Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> of the bedchamber;
her Majesty must consult Lady Bute upon
everything.... Lord Bath always inquires after you

<div class="sidenote">A LETTER OF ADVICE — <span lang="fr">LES BELLES LETTRES</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE FEAR OF GOD</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu’s letter of advice to Mr. Thomas
Lyttelton, who had now left Eton and gone to Christ
Church, Oxford, though undated, may be placed here.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Tunbridge, 28 (July?).</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I have often check’d my inclination to write to
you while you were at Eton for fear of calling you off
from your school exercises; but as you are now in a
situation, where there is a vacancy of business and
pleasure, I do not feel the same scruples, may write
you long letters, and expect full answers to them. However,
I will be so far reasonable, that if you send me a
card, to signify that you are engaged for the week, or
month, to Cicero or Livy, it will be a more valid excuse
to me than if, on inviting you to dinner, you told me you
were engaged to a beauty or a Duchess. My love for
you, my hope of you, my wishes for you, and my expectations
from you, unite in giving me a respect for your
time, and a deep concern for your employment of it.
The morning of life, like the morning of the day, should
be dedicated to business. On the proper use of that
‘sweet hour of prime’ will depend the glory of your
noon of life, and serenity of the evening. Give it, therefore,
dear Mr. Lyttelton, to the strenuous exertion and
labour of the mind, before the indolence of the meridian
hour, or the unabated fervour of the exhausted day
renders you unfit for severe application. I hope you
will not (like many young men who have been reckoned
good scholars at Eton and Westminster) take leave of
it there, and fall into the study of <i>les belles lettres</i>, as we
call our modern books. I suppose from the same courtesy<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_254">[254]</span>
the weakest part of the rational species is styled the fair
sex, though it can boast of few perfect beauties, and
perhaps the utmost grace and dignity of the human form
is never found in it. As you have got a key to the sacred
shades of Parnassus, do not lose your time in sauntering
in the homely orchards or diminutive pleasure gardens
of the latter times. If the ancient inhabitants of Parnassus
were to look down from their immortal bowers
on our labyrinths, whose greatest boast is a fanciful
intricacy, our narrow paths where genius cannot take
his bounding steps, and all the pert ornaments in our
parterres of wit, they would call them the modern’s folly;
a name the wise farmer often gives to some spot from
whence the Squire has banished the golden harvest, to
trim it up for pleasure with paltry ornaments and quaint
conceits. I should be sorry to see you quit Thucydides
for Voltaire, Livy for Vertot, Xenophon for the bragging
Memoirs of French Marshals, and the universal Tully
and deep Tacitus for speculative politicians, modern
orators, and the dreamers in Universities or convents.
I will own that in Natural Philosophy and some of the
lesser branches of learning the Moderns excel; but it
would not be right for a person of your situation to
strike into any private paths of Science. The study of
History will best fit you for active life. From history
you will acquire a knowledge of mankind, and a true
judgment in politics; in moral, as well as physical enquiries,
we should have recourse to experiments. As to
the particular study of eloquence, I need hardly exhort
you to do it; for eloquence is not only the most beautiful
of all the daughters of wisdom, but has also the
best dowry; and we may say of her, as Solomon did of
her Mother, riches and honours are in her right hand.
Elevation of sentiment and dignity of language are
necessary to make an orator; modern life and modern
language will hardly inspire you with either. I look
upon Virtue as the muse of Eloquence, she inspired the
phillippics of the Grecian and Roman Orator, her voice
awakened Rome, slumbering in the snares of Catiline.<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_255">[255]</span>
Public spirit will teach the art of public speaking better
than the rules of rhetoric, but above all things, the
character of the orator gives persuasion, grace, and
dignity to the Oration. Integrity of Manners gives the
best testimony of sincerity of speech. If you form your
conduct upon the sacred book which gives rules far more
perfect than human wisdom could contrive, you will be
an honour to religion, a support to your country, and a
blessing to your family. It may seem strange that I
have last mentioned what should be first regarded. The
Bible alone will make a good man; human learning without
the fear of God, which is the beginning of Wisdom
and the knowledge of Him, which is understanding, will
produce but a poor inconsistent character; but duties
are enlarged and multiplied by the power and circumstances
with which God has intrusted us, and in which
He has placed us. Your talents and situation will fit
you for public trusts; it is a duty in you to qualify yourself
for them, to give your virtue every strength, and
then to employ it in the service of your country in its
most important interests, true religion, and good government.
I hope you will excuse my having said so much,
that has the air of advice to one who wants it so little,
but young people are apt to be prodigal of time because
they think they have so many years before them; but if
life be long, the season for improvement is short.</p>

<p>“I hope Mrs. Fortescue<a id="2_FNanchor_335" href="#2_Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> liked the Indian paper; it
is new and uncommon, and I thought much prettier

it. I shall leave Tunbridge on Monday. I have enjoyed
perfect health here, and the society of some of my best
friends, so you may believe I have passed the season
very happily, but a happy life seems always a short
one. Mrs. Carter was so good as to give me her
company in my house. My Lord Lyttelton and my<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_256">[256]</span>
Lord Bath were often with us; having had their characters
continually before me, you will not wonder I
should think great acquirements as well as great talents
necessary to make all possible perfection. I am sure
you will be pleased to hear that my Lord Bath greatly
approves and admires that part of my Lord Lyttelton’s
history which is already printed. I believe there is not
any one living whose approbation would give Lord
Lyttelton so much pleasure; talents and virtues and
extensive knowledge all in the highest degree join to
make him a perfect judge, and his great reputation
gives him a decisive authority; your Father is proud
of his praise as a critick, and pleased with it on motives
of friendship, which touch his heart more nearly than
any where vanity has a part, tho’ he is an author and a
poet. His Lordship’s Muse met him in the shades of
Penshurst, and with love or flattery prompted two
charming pieces, one to Mrs. Carter, and one to my
Lord Bath. Mrs. Carter, Dr. Monsey and Mr. Montagu
desire their compliments to you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CORONATION</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu went to London for the coronation,
which took place September 22, leaving Mr. Montagu
at Sandleford. She writes to him—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have not got any cold or mischief from the
coronation, at half an hour after four I got into the
coach, went by Fulham to Lambeth, from whence I
crossed the water in a boat which landed me at the
cofferer’s office, where I was to see the Show. I had<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_259">[259]</span>
a perfect view of the procession to and from Westminster
to the Abbey, and I must say it rather exceeded
my expectation. The ladies made a glorious appearance;
whenever there was any beauty of countenance or shape
or air they were all heightened by the dress. Lady
Talbot was a fine figure. The Queen, being very little,
did not appear to advantage. The King had all the
impressions of decent satisfaction and good-natured
joy in his face; looked about him with great complacency,
and tried to make himself as visible as he
could to the mob, but the canopy carried over his
Majesty’s head and the persons who carried his train
made him not so conspicuous. His behaviour at the
Abbey pleased much. It was perfectly dark before
the Procession returned from the Abbey, so we lost
the second view. I got into a barge which I hired
for 7<i><abbr title="shillings and">s.</abbr></i> 6<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i>, and got to the coach which waited at Yorke
buildings. Mr. Botham and his daughters are just
gone. Lord Lyttelton was near fainting away just as
the procession set out from the Hall, and was obliged
to sit down and take drops till a chair could be got
to carry him home. Lady Albemarle fainted presently
after. Lord Grantham was ill, but able to go thro’ the
ceremony.</p>

<p>“The early hour the Peers and Peeresses are forced
to rise at and the weight of their robes and all the
whole affair is fatiguing, but they make a good figure,
for there is something very majestick in the dress.</p>

<p>“I believe my Lord Bath will come down to us
about Wednesday or perhaps Tuesday. I shall be at
Sandleford on Monday.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">HIS MAJESTY’S BEHAVIOUR</div>

<p>In another letter describing the coronation to Mrs.
Carter, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is impossible to say enough of the behaviour
of the King. During the procession his countenance
expressed a benevolent joy in the vast concourse of
people and their loud acclamations, but with not the<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_260">[260]</span>
least air of pride or insolent exultation. In the religious
offices his Majesty behaved with the greatest reverence
and deepest attention; he pronounced with earnest
solemnity his engagements to his people, and when
he was to receive the Sacrament he pulled off his
crown. How happy that in the day of the greatest
worldly pomp and adorned with the ensigns of regal
power he should remember his duty to the King of
Kings. The Archbishop pleased much in the Coronation
Service. I am indeed grieved at the heart for
Mrs. Chapone:<a id="2_FNanchor_339" href="#2_Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> all calamities are light in comparison
of the loss of what one loves, uniquement; after that
dear object is lost the glories of the golden day are
for ever overcast, and there is no tranquillity under the

business may employ and diversions amuse the mind,
but the <i>soul’s calm sunshine and the heartfelt joy</i> can
never be regained. Mrs. Chapone has great virtues,

<div class="sidenote">LORD LYTTELTON’S LETTER</div>

<p>On October 5 Lord Lyttelton writes to Mrs. Montagu
from Hagley a long letter, an extract of which I
give—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tom proposes to give a ball to some young people
of the neighbourhood on this day sennight, which will
add to our number and our jollity. He desires me to<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_262">[262]</span>
tell you that if you were within twenty miles of our
Ball-room he would invite you to it among the handsome
<i>young</i> women; which you may notify to the cynic
Monsey, when he talks to you next of the <i>horrid gulph of
forty</i>, and bid him hold his fool’s tongue. I believe you
fib about your age and make yourself at least ten years
older than you are, to be nearer to Lord Bath. I hope
you have been, and are still as happy with him at
Sandleford as your heart can desire. You will not
think it a compliment to either of you when I say, that
I would be glad to exchange all the mirth of our ball
for the dullest of your evenings; but I will add in great
truth, that I would give up the finest day in Hagley
Park for a rainy one in your company. I had a letter
last post from the Dean,<a id="2_FNanchor_340" href="#2_Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> in which he says, ‘Your Lordship
must not be surprised if you hear in a post or two
of Mr. Secretary Pitt’s and Lord Temple’s being out of
their employments. Unless something extraordinary
happens, this event will certainly take place in a few
days. I have this intelligence not from common report,
but from the best authority. The reason given for their
resignation is the opposition made in the Cabinet to Mr.
Pitt’s proposal of sending a fleet immediately to intercept
the Spanish Flota daily expected home, and likewise
to attack their men-of-war wherever they are to be
found, but your Lordship knows there are other causes
of discontent.’ If this should be true, I imagine Lord
Egremont<a id="2_FNanchor_341" href="#2_Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> will be Secretary of State and Lord Hardwick<a id="2_FNanchor_342" href="#2_Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
Privy Seal. Mr. James Grenville will probably
lay down with his brother, which will make a vacancy
at the Cofferer’s Office, one of the few I might take if
there was an inclination to bring me into employment.
I wish much to know Lord Bath’s opinion of Pitt’s
advice. To me it seems to be that of a man who (in a
political sense) <i>fears neither God nor man</i>. It certainly
must be founded upon a supposition that a war with
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_263">[263]</span>Spain is inevitable, which I should hope is not true;
and even in that case I think England ought to be very
cautious not to appear the aggressor, which this conduct
would make her. But I had rather hear his Lordship’s
judgment upon this question than give my own.”</p>

<p>Lord Bath had left Sandleford before this letter

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can never sufficiently, Madam, acknowledge my
great obligations to you and to Mr. Montagu for the
honours I received at Sandleford. Six more agreeable
days I never passed in my whole Life, but when one has
been excessively happy we always pay most severely
for the change, when forced to quit it. This made the
Doctor’s<a id="2_FNanchor_343" href="#2_Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> journey and mine most excessively stupid and
melancholy. He was seized with such a soporifick
Torpor (as if a deluge of rain was hanging in the clouds),
and yet we had not a drop the whole way, and I was so
wretchedly miserable, that all I could say to him was,
‘Doctor, I passed over this same ground yesterday
from coming from Padworth much more cheerfully and
happily than I do now, but one comfort is that we are
allowed the liberty of hoping for a renewal of the same
happiness some other time.’ When we got to Reading,
where we stopped for 10 or 12 minutes (without getting
out of our chaize), our landlady seeing we looked
melancholy, endeavoured to comfort us by telling us
a piece of good news, that an express was just arrived
with an account of a complete victory obtained by the
King of Prussia over the Russians. On this we speculated
and ruminated for some time, when we met Mr.
Cambridge, who assured us it was all a lye, but that
another event had occurred which would surprize us
extremely, and then told us Mr. Pitt<a id="2_FNanchor_344" href="#2_Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> had quitted the
seals; this astonished the Doctor more than it did me,<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_264">[264]</span>
who had received some hint of it before, but we both
agreed it was a very unlucky time for adventuring on
such rough measures, so near the Meeting of Parliament,
and before anything was fixed for the obtaining of peace,
or preparing for a further prosecution of the War; in
short, we ended in wishing all Ministers at the Devil,
rather than that their disagreements and dissentions
amongst one another should bring any difficulties or
dishonour on the best man in the world, the master of
all of them.... I will make this reflection upon all
human happiness, that the state and duration of it is
extremely uncertain. A minister may be a very great
and think himself a very happy man one day, and
nothing at all the very next. Just so was I, Madam,
happy beyond measure a few days ago, and now forced
at a terrible distance to be assuring you that I am, with
all possible respect,</p>

£3000 a year for three lives are agreeable circumstances
in a retreat, which delivers him from the difficulty of
carrying on the War, or making the Peace, and keeps
all his laurels green and unfading on his brow. No
Minister in this country has ever known so well the
times and seasons of going in and coming out with
advantage to himself. I hope there will be new gold
boxes sent to him by the cities and Boroughs to express
their sense of his noble and <i>disinterested</i> conduct, and to
assure him that their lives and fortunes are all at his
service. In effect, I hear that all over this country since
first we had the news of his resigning the Seals, the cry
of the people in Taverns and Alehouses is, ‘No Pitt, no<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_265">[265]</span>

holding his tongue for a very good one. Why, he might
have been Governor-General of all North America with
a pension of £5000. This was confidently said at the
‘Mount’ Coffee House as offered by the King, and was
told by Manby as coming from P——, <i>no joke indeed</i>, no
more than he has advertised seven good horses, ‘<i>late

to you upon what the King has been so very gracious as
to do for my family, in granting a pension of three
thousand pounds a year to Mr. Pitt for three lives, and
as he knows that he feels a repugnancy to having his
name upon the Irish pensions, his is upon the American
Duties, and the Peerage which his Majesty has also
done him the honour to bestow upon his family is given
to Lady Hester,<a id="2_FNanchor_345" href="#2_Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> who is made Baroness of Chatham, by
which means he is left still at liberty to be an Alderman;
as to all the rest, which you may know, I will do <i>comme

Seals of Secretary of State yesterday, my Lord Temple<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_266">[266]</span>
gave up his seals yesterday, and I was informed last
night that my Lord Hardwick was to be Privy Seal,
which I do not doubt, tho’ it is not declared. Mr.
George Grenville is not to be Speaker, that he may
have the management of the House of Commons. My
Lord Temple is very angry with him, and I believe very
much disappointed; at the same time I am assured that
my Lord Bristol writes in the strongest manner everything
that can give satisfaction to the present Ministry
with regard to the intentions of the Spanish Court, and
those despatches are said to have come Wednesday last....

later Mrs. Montagu also repaired. Bath society was enthusiastic
upon the subject of Mr. Pitt and a political
letter he wrote at this period. From a letter written from
Bath to Mrs. Carter about a Mrs. Talbot, a reduced
lady, who was an applicant for a lady’s-maid situation,
we learn that £10 per annum were regarded as adequate
wages for such an attendant. I subjoin a curious paragraph
as to a widow’s dress—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fashionable dress for a widow is a gown with
two broad plaits in the back, a short cuff which comes a
little below the elbow, round double ruffles very shallow.
The dress weed is made of silk made on purpose, undress
crape, a black silk long apron, black handkerchief,
<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_267">[267]</span>black hood, and a plain sort of night-cap. Either a night-gown
or sack may be worn with a short train, no flounce
or ornament of any sort, and if a sack scanty, and only
two broad plaits. Many women of condition who are
not young, wear merely a common crape sack, the
younger sort wear the dress that denotes their widowhood,
and in a country town I should suppose the full
form must be observed. I imagine your enquiry is for
poor Mrs. Primrose.”</p>

and many others of the tuneful train and we had the
feast of shells and drank out of a nautilus to the
immortal memory of Ossian. The Nautilus, you know,
is a perfect sailor as the other is a poet by nature. I
am a little mortified that you had not a word to fling at

<p>Lord Bath had remarkably penetrating and brilliant

in the representation of this feature.</p>

<p>The next letter from Lord Bath runs—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How cruel was it, before I got out of bed, to receive

do; instead of being half standing, which criticism of
Mr. Sterne’s I think perfectly right; as for my looks, I
fear they will not be much mended by any Physick of
Mr. Reynolds. He has made an old man look as if he
was in pain, which an old man generally is, and so far
he is right.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu took Mr. Sterne to the sittings so
that he might amuse Lord Bath with his <i>bons mots</i>!

any artist would paint it.</p>

Carter looked forward in a nervous frame of mind,
Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">“LONG” SIR THOMAS ROBINSON.</h4>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir Thomas</span> was the eldest of the seven sons of William Robinson,
of Rokeby, Yorkshire, by his wife, <i>née</i> Anne Walters. He was
born and baptized at Rokeby in 1700. After his school-days
he made the grand tour, as was the fashion of the day, and then
entered the Army. At the death of his father in 1719, he succeeded
to the family estates in Yorkshire. At the General Election of 1727
he became M.P. for Morpeth. On October 25, 1728, he was married
at Belfreys, in Yorkshire, to Elizabeth, widow of Nicholas, Lord
Lechmere, and daughter of Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle.
Between the years 1725 and 1730 he rebuilt the house at Rokeby,
removed the church which stood behind the house and rebuilt it
in another spot, he added a stone wall all round the park, made a
bridge over the Greta river, and erected an obelisk to his mother’s
memory in 1730. All these acts were recorded on two stone piers
at the Greta entrance of the park. He planted many trees at Rokeby.
He designed the west wing of Castle Howard for his brother-in-law,
Lord Carlisle. In 1731 he was made a Baronet of England, with
remainder to his brothers. His nickname of “Long” Sir Thomas
Robinson was given to him from his great height, and to distinguish
him from another Sir Thomas Robinson, a diplomat of note, afterwards
created Lord Grantham. These two men were the reverse of
each other in appearance, “Long” Sir Thomas being exceptionally
tall, and the other very short and fat. One of Lady Townshend’s
<i>bon mots</i> about the two was, “Why one should be preferred to the
other I can’t imagine, there is but little difference, the one is as
broad as the other is long;” and Lord Chesterfield, on being told
“Long” Sir Thomas was reported to be “dying by inches,” said,
then it would be some time before he was dead. On April 10,
1739, his wife, to whom he was tenderly attached, died at Bath, and<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_276">[276]</span>
was taken to Rokeby and buried under the new church he had
erected. A monument was erected to her there. In accordance
with Sir Thomas’s will, though he himself was buried at Merton
Abbey, Surrey, a cenotaph was placed in Poets’ Corner, Westminster
Abbey, to his and his wife’s memory, with medallion portraits of her
and himself, and bearing the following inscription:—“To perpetuate
his grateful sense of the pleasure he had in the conversation of an
accomplished woman, a sincere friend, and an agreeable companion.”
They had no children, so the English baronetcy went to his next
brother, William.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas was greatly given to hospitality; too much so for his
income. On October 22, 1741, he gave a great ball, as Horace
Walpole relates, “to a little girl of the Duke of Richmond’s; there
are already 200 invited, from miss in a bib and apron to my Lord
Chancellor in bib and mace.” The ball began at 8 p.m., and ended
at 4 a.m. A few days after Horace Walpole writes, “There were a
197 persons at Sir Thomas’s, and yet it was so well conducted that
nobody felt a crowd. He had taken off all his doors, and so separated
the old and the young that neither were inconvenienced by the other.
The ball began at 8; each man danced one minuet with his partner,
and then began country dances. There were four-and-twenty couple,
divided into twelve and twelve; each set danced two dances, and
then retired into another room, while the other set took their two,
and so alternately.... We danced till 4, then had tea and coffee
and came home.” A month later he writes about a second ball.
What with his numerous entertainments and his building at Rokeby
and elsewhere, he became impoverished, and accepted the Governorship
of Barbadoes in January, 1742, from which he was recalled in
1747. In Barbadoes he married his second wife, a widow named
Salmon, <i>née</i> Booth. She had a considerable fortune, but on her
husband’s return to England, she refused to accompany him, preferring
Barbadoes. Sir Thomas was intimate with Lord Chesterfield,
who made an epigram on him, beginning—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Unlike my subject will I make my song,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It shall be witty, and it shan’t be long.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He must have been a bore, for Sir John Hawkins says of him, “Sir
Thomas Robinson was a man of the world, or rather of the town, and
a great pest to persons of high rank or in office. He was very
troublesome to the Earl of Burlington, and when in his visits to him
he was told his lordship had gone out, would desire to be admitted
to look at a clock, or play with a monkey that was kept in the hall,<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_277">[277]</span>
in hopes of being sent for to the Earl. This he had so frequently
done that all the household were tired of him. At length it was concerted
amongst the servants that he should receive a summary answer
to his usual questions; and accordingly, at his next coming the
porter, as soon as he had opened the gate, and without waiting for
what he had to say, dismissed him with these words, ‘Sir, his lordship
is gone out, the clock stands, and the monkey is dead!’” The
Duchess of Portland used to name him to Mrs. Montagu as “your
inimitable cousin!”</p>

<p>Appearing in Paris one day at a dinner in his hunting suit of
green and gold, and booted and spurred, a French abbé asked who
he was, and, on being told his name, and looking at his attire, inquired
if he was Robinson Crusoe. His house at Whitehall he sold to Lord
Lincoln, and he afterwards lived at Prospect Place, Chelsea. He
bought the gardens once belonging to Lord Ranelagh, and, with
other shareholders, erected the Rotunda in 1741–42. This place of
amusement lasted for quite forty years; the site of it is in the gardens
of Chelsea Hospital.</p>

<p>At the Coronation of George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> Sir Thomas, probably from
his great height and majestic presence, was chosen to represent the
mock Duke of Normandy and Acquitaine, the kings of England still
pretending to own those provinces.</p>

<p>In 1769 he sold the estate of Rokeby, Yorks, to John Saurey
Morritt, the father of Sir Walter Scott’s friend. The Rokeby estate
had been in the possession of the Robinsons 160 years. On March 3,
1777, Sir Thomas Robinson died at his house in Prospect Place,
Chelsea, at the age of seventy-six.</p>

<h4>SANDLEFORD PRIORY, BERKS.</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sandleford Priory</span> was founded for Austin Canons by Geoffrey,
4th Count of Perche, and his wife, Matilda of Saxony, grand-daughter
of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> of England, and niece of King Richard Cœur de Lion,
and King John, before the year 1205. The town and manor of Newbury,
in Berkshire, were bestowed on the first Count of Perche, who
accompanied the Conqueror to England. The Priory was dedicated
to the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist. A dispute arising
between the Prior and Richard Beauchamp, Bishop of Salisbury and
Dean of Windsor about 1480, the religious forsook the house, and
King Edward <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> allowed the Priory to be annexed to the Chapel of
St. George’s, Windsor. In the Ayscough Register, folio 50, will be
found an account of irregular and scandalous behaviour of the Prior
of that period, which probably was the cause of the disruption. The
Priory now formed a parcel of the properties of the Dean and Canons
of Windsor, and it is stated by the commissioners of Henry VIII.
(<i>vide</i> c. 3, Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>) to be worth £10 annually.</p>

<p>In the reign of James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> Sandleford was declared to be a separate
parish from Newbury, and not subject to tithes which had hitherto
been paid to the Rector of Newbury. After this a commutation was
made that the lessee of the house paid £8 a year to the Rector of
Newbury, and for that sum had a pew in perpetuity. It is stated
that after this award the chapel of the Priory was allowed to fall into
decay. This chapel was separate from the house, and continued to
be so till 1781–2, when Mrs. Montagu employed Wyatt to build her
an octagonal drawing-room with ante-chambers, which united the
house and the chapel. Long previous to this it was used as a bedroom
or bedrooms, and in the Montagu manuscripts Hannah More
and others are described as sleeping in the chapel bedroom when the
rest of the house was occupied. At the beginning of the eighteenth
century the lessees of Sandleford were the Pitt Rivers of Strathfieldsaye,
and they were succeeded by the Montagu family as early as
1730, or perhaps earlier. At any rate, at that date Mr. Edward
Montagu was resident there, and as his mother, <i>née</i> Sarah Rogers,
lived with him (as is shown by a letter of 1733 which I possess), it is<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_279">[279]</span>
possible Mr. Charles Montagu had been lessee before his son. He
died in 1721. At what period the chapel was dismantled I have no
record, but it may have been done by order of the Dean and Canons
of Windsor before their letting it as a residence. Elias Ashmole, the
great antiquarian, who died in 1692, describes the chapel as he saw
it, and says, “Upon the first ascent of steps towards the high altar
lyes a freestone tomb of a knight in mail, cross-legged, with a deep
shield on his left arm, and seeming to draw his sword, his feet resting
on a dragon. Written on the west wall is a Latin inscription.” In a
paper belonging to my uncle, the last Baron Rokeby, it is stated
the inscription was “written on the north wall of the chapel, but
more anciently on the west wall.”</p>

<p>This was the inscription:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="la">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Lancea, crux, clavi</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">As to the monument, it has been stated to have been that of the
founder, Geoffrey, Count of Perche; but as he died in France at the
siege of Acre, it is more likely to have been his son Thomas, Earl of
Perche, who died at the battle of Lincoln in 1217; or else it is quite
possible that it might be one of the Earls Marshal of Pembroke, as at
the death of Thomas, Earl de Perche, his uncle William, Bishop of
Chalons, seems to have claimed the property and sold it to William,
2nd Earl Marshal. Anyhow, not a trace of this monument is now
to be found. And it would be very interesting to ascertain if it was
removed to the Temple church, where the other Earls Marshal of
Pembroke are buried and a very similar monument exists; but this
is only my surmise. Behind the chapel, when Mrs. Montagu made
her alterations in house and garden in 1780 to 1782 with the designs
of Wyatt and “Capability Browne,” a number of skulls and bones
were found, and, with the characteristic irreverence of the eighteenth
century, were buried in what is now called “Monkey Lane,” near
Newbury. The present library was originally the refectory. In 1836
Edward, 5th Baron Rokeby, parted with the lease of Sandleford to
Mr. William Chatteris, who eventually, in 1875, enfranchised the property
from the Dean and Canons of Windsor, and, dying a widower
and without issue, he left Sandleford to his second wife’s nephew<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_280">[280]</span>
Mr. Alpin Macgregor. Mrs. Chatteris was the second daughter of
Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, the friend of Nelson. Mrs. Myers, who
has a lease of Sandleford now, will not use the chapel as a dining-room.
Hannah More, writing in 1784, whilst staying at Sandleford,
says, “There is an irregular beauty and greatness in the new buildings,
and in the cathedral aisles which open to the great Gothic
window (alluding to the east end of the chapel, still all glass), which
is exceedingly agreeable to the imagination. It is solemn without
being sad, and Gothic without being gloomy.”</p>

<h4>DENTON HALL, NEAR NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE,
NORTHUMBERLAND.</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Denton Hall dates from the ancient Britons, and a
burial-place of theirs, with an urn and bones, was found near the
Roman wall within a quarter of a mile from the hall. It subsequently
became the site of a Roman camp, which was occupied by a
garrison of Hadrian’s soldiers, and a wall was built to keep out the
Picts and Scots. Of the Roman relics there still exist an altar dedicated
to Jupiter, and several carved stones, and in Mrs. Montagu’s
time many Roman coins and objects were discovered. In No. 7,
Vol. 2, of the <i>Proceedings of Antiquaries of Newcastle-on-Tyne</i>,
1885, Mr. W. Aubone Hoyle, then living with his brother at the
hall, writes, “A little to the south-west stood a chapel, of which a
baptismal font remains and a few sculptured stones; adjoining these
was a burial-ground, which is now included in the garden. An
incised slab, with a memorial cross and sword, was found here some
years ago, as well as some large stone coffins; and a cist of ancient
British times, containing a funeral urn. The chapel was removed
shortly after the Reformation. The earliest record we have of the
occupants is of a family of the name of Denton, in the tenth century,
who continued to hold lands here and in the neighbourhood, and
also at Newcastle.”</p>

<p>The Widdringtons seem to have succeeded the Dentons, and
Mr. Hoyle continues, “The manor of Denton, saving these rents
paid to the Widdringtons, had been, in 1380, granted to the Prior
and Convent of Tynemouth, and was used by them as a country
residence or grange. Tradition relates that they had an underground
passage leading from Denton to their residence at Benwell Tower.
The present building was probably erected by them at the beginning
of the sixteenth century—1503 being the date of erection. The
Roman wall skirting its grounds appears to have supplied the
materials, as most of the stones are of the Roman type. The roof
was formed of flags fastened with pins made of sheep bones. These
have gradually been done away with until only a few courses remain,<span class="pagenum" id="2_Page_282">[282]</span>
and the flags have been replaced by tiles. At the Dissolution in
1539, the Widdringtons lost their interest in Denton, and the Erringtons
appear.”</p>

<p>The Erringtons being Jacobites, Mr. Hoyle continues, “Their
loyalty to the Stuarts cost them their estates, which now passed
to a family of Rogers, related to the Earl of Sandwich.” As has
been shown in this book, Mr. Edward Montagu, at the death of
his cousin, Mr. Rogers, became owner, to quote his wife’s words,
“of Denton; Mr. Montagu has half the estate by descent, a share by
testamentary disposition, and a part by purchase.” At the death of
Mrs. Montagu in 1800, the estate passed into the possession of her
nephew and adopted son, Matthew Montagu, afterwards 4th Baron
Rokeby, who let the hall to Mr. Richard Hoyle, and his descendants
occupied the house till 1889. Henry, 6th Baron Rokeby, dying in
1883, left the estate of Denton to his grandson, Lord Henry Paulet,
now 16th Marquis of Winchester, who in 1886 sold the whole
estate. The hall was bought by Mr. John Henderson, of Allendale,
who resold it to Mr. William Andrew I’Anson, the present
owner. The Denton ghost, called “Old Silky” by the miners, one
of the most authentic on record, is a beneficent spirit, for she is said
on various occasions to have warned the miners against coal-damp.
A song about her is still sung, I am told, in Newcastle, but hitherto I
have failed to obtain it, or to discover who “Silky” was. A further
account of her can be read in <cite>Ingram’s “Haunted Homes,”</cite> under
“Denton Hall.”</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
